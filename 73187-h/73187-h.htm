<p>It has been thought that the Public would benefit in
more ways than one, by the publication of a work, in
which the philosopher may read the workings of an unprincipled
conscience, the legislator be let into the operations
of the laws upon the criminal’s mind, and the
citizen derive a key to the frauds by which he is so
easily and constantly beset; and it is not often that thieves
are possessed of sufficient truth, memory, vanity, and
literature, to tell the story of their own lives. It will
be seen that Mr. Vaux, together with an excellent memory,
possesses a good share of vanity, and sufficient
literature. In the following pages, the former (I think)
often magnifies the latter, particularly in the account of
the author’s readership at the printing-office; but it is
only justice to him to say, that I have found occasion to
make very few alterations in his manuscript, which came
to my hands ready prefaced and dedicated, and chaptered,
as if ripe for his old master’s printing-office—that it was
exceedingly well and fairly transcribed; and, (with one
or two exceptions) correctly spelled and punctuated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>When Mr. Vaux’s predilection for low company comes
to be observed, the reader will justly doubt the great
liberality of education and taste for reading, upon which
he so often vaunts himself. The quotations in his narrative
are all common-place; and I have struck out a
few as profaned by misapplication.</p>

<p>As for the truth of the following tale—nobody can
vouch for it. I am afraid it is occasionally sacrificed at
the shrine of Vanity, who seems to be the author’s patron-saint.
He is fonder of confessing himself guilty of frauds,
from the punishment of which he escaped, than of those
in which he was found out; detection (he thinks) impeaches
his cunning; and though he recounts with exultation
the theft for which he is now transported for life,
that is, because he knows it was committed under protection
of, perhaps, the most consummate address and assurance
ever exhibited by man—it amounted to the sublime
of impudence—and, after all, he was only betrayed
into the hands of justice, who, if she had a hundred eyes,
would not (it should seem) have enough to detect the
dissimulations of James Hardy Vaux. The reader will
observe, that he denies his guilt of the crime for which he
was before transported, because it was a common,
clumsy partnership picking a handkerchief out of the
pocket; and so, too, he denies any confederacy with
the Judge Advocate’s servant, in robbing his master’s
writing-desk, for which offence he was further transported
to Newcastle, in this territory, whither he now
again is sent for life, for an attempt to escape from the
country altogether. The reader must, therefore, believe as
much or as little as he pleases of the following story.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
Of him who confesses himself a liar, the voice must necessarily
be listened to with distrust.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look to him well; have a quick eye to see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has deceiv’d another, and may thee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By the laws of all nations, he who is once detected in
perjury, is not allowed to bear further witness—the testimony
of a king’s evidence must be corroborated—and
the confession of a felon is never allowed to prove any
thing against another person.</p>

<p>With this <i>caveat lector</i>, I dismiss this entertaining and
instructive narrative; for so I will call it, thinking it as
full of cunning and adventure as “The Life of Guzman
de Alfarache—the Spanish Rogue,” if not so profoundly
moralized. The religion, indeed, (if it can be so called)
of Mr. Vaux is, like that of most convicts, a low sort of
fatalism, which may be called <i>a fatalism after the fact</i>.
The followers of this sect do not connect predestination
with “foreknowledge absolute,” but merely comfort
themselves with the truism, that when their <i>misfortunes</i>
have happened, nothing can prevent them from having
happened. Of “free will,” they first suffer the time for
the exercise to go by, and then complain of the impotency,—abandoning
themselves with an insensibility, which
they mistake for resignation, to what they call the predestined
and inevitable decrees of “fixed fate<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.” Some
of this false complaining has been expunged from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
following work; but enough (I am afraid) is left to shew
the delusion.</p>

<p>It remains only to be added, that the pecuniary profits
of this publication will be applied to the relief of the
author, in his perpetual banishment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Before I commence this narrative of a
life marked with more than common vicissitudes,
I beg to bespeak the reader’s attention
to a few cursory remarks. I must first premise
that I have undertaken the task, in obedience
to the commands of a gentleman, who
is pleased to anticipate a sufficient fund of entertainment
in the perusal, to compensate for
the honour he confers in noticing an outcast of
Fortune like myself; who, partly from my own
vicious conduct, and partly (perhaps,) from the
malignity of my fate, have forfeited all hope of
attaining that respectable rank in society, to
which, in the happy days of youthful innocence,
I had every reason to look forward with confidence.</p>

<p>But now, alas! although I have too late
seen my errors, and my intentions are strictly
virtuous, I have nothing to expect, but to continue
through the remainder of this transitory<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
life, such as I am at the present moment,—an
unhappy exile, for ever banished from my
country and relations, and rendered incapable
of making the smallest reparation to the community
I have injured, by the exercise of those
talents which nature has bestowed, and the
best of friends have so liberally cultivated. Nor
do I fear being accused of vanity, in asserting,
that they are above mediocrity, since it is not
to myself I am indebted for them; and the
greater infamy attaches to me for their perversion,—for
where much is given much is
required.</p>

<p>To return to the remark I set out with: these
sheets not being intended at first for the press, or
to meet the public eye, I have not laboured their
composition. Indeed, the work being executed
in haste, and under many local disadvantages,
I have had little time for study, and can only
boast of a scrupulous attention to truth, to
which I have been enjoined by my employer.</p>

<p>Where my conduct has been such as I now
blush at, I have “nothing extenuated;” nor
have I, on the other hand, used the smallest
embellishments to advance myself in the good
opinion of my readers. With me, in all human<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
probability, the die is cast; and as the
prejudices of those persons, who alone can extricate
me from misery, are not likely to be
removed by any professions of amendment I
can make, my only hopes of happiness are
centred in a better world, where we are instructed
that there is much joy over one single
repentant sinner.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Having, in obedience to your commands,
completed the following narrative of my adventures
I should deem myself wanting in gratitude, were I
to omit offering, at the same time that I respectfully
submit my production to your perusal, the humble
tribute of my thanks, for the many favours I have
received at your hands; for the indulgent treatment I
have generally experienced; and more particularly for
the distinguished honour you have conferred on so unworthy
an object as myself, in condescending to feel
an interest in the occurrences of my former life, and
in permitting me to inscribe to you, the following
Memoirs of it.</p>

<p>I beg to assure you, Sir, that, however Fate or
Fortune may hereafter dispose of me, the remembrance
of your goodness will never be effaced from<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
my mind; and that in the event of my past sufferings
inducing you to use your bountiful influence in my
behalf, and to procure me once more the probable
means of attaining a respectable rank in society, my
future conduct shall be such, as to prove that you
have not erred in believing me radically reformed,
and deserving the honour of your patronage.</p>

<p>In the sincere hope that these sheets will contribute

<p class="short"><i>Some Account of my Family.—My Birth and subsequent
Adventures until I attained my ninth Year.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It may be expected that, like other biographers,
I should give some account of my ancestors. This
I can but imperfectly do; for the volatility of my
disposition, and the early age at which I left my
friends, prevented me from ever making pointed inquiries
on the subject. Family pride I have ever
considered as the most ridiculous of all human weaknesses.
However, as I am writing facts, be it
known, that my progenitors, by the mother’s side,
were of no mean rank; my great-great-grandmother,
Dorothy, the daughter of Sir Thomas Hartopp,
Bart. of Ragby, or Ragley Castle, in ⸺shire,
was united, after a long and romantic courtship,
to a gentleman named Yonge, and from this<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
union sprang a very respectable family, the Yonges
of ⸺shire, who are still of some consequence in
that county. This scrap of genealogy I should
probably have been unacquainted with, but for the
circumstance of two original love-letters, interchanged
between the parties above-mentioned,
during the period of their courtship, and still
preserved in the family as antiques. These epistles
are written in the most pathetic strain, and, allowing
for the age in which they were composed,
abound in elegant diction. My grandmother, Dorothy
Yonge, married Mr. Lowe, a respectable attorney
of the court of King’s-Bench, who for many
years filled the office of clerk to the warden of the
Fleet, and had, besides, a very extensive private
practice. The only issue of this marriage was my
mother, who was brought up with the most affectionate
tenderness, and well educated. By what
means she became acquainted with my father, who
was from a very distant county, I never learnt; but
she was united to him in the year 1781, and, as I
have reason to think, against the advice and will of
her parents, my father being of a family much less
respectable, and, at the time of his marriage, in no
higher situation than that of butler and house-steward
to Mr. Sumner, a member of parliament, whose
estate was situated near Guildford, in Surrey; where
my mother, it appears, went to reside after her
union, of which I was the first fruits, being born at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
the village of East Clandon, on the 20th of May,
1782. My father shortly afterwards quitted the
family of Mr. Sumner, and obtained a similar post
in the service of Sir Richard Hill, Bart., with whom
he continued several years.</p>

<p>In the year 1785, my grandfather, being advanced
in life and naturally fond of domestic retirement,
quitted the profession to which, by his integrity and
honour, he had long been an ornament; and prevailing
on my parents to commit me to his care, removed
with my grandmother to S⸺ in S⸺shire,
I being then about three years of age. In
this neat little town, surrounded by the relatives of
my grandmother, and many friends of his own, my
grandfather having served his clerkship in the county,
this worthy and truly virtuous couple enjoyed,
for several years, uninterrupted happiness, their only
care being centred in the education and indulgence
of their grandson, of whom they every day became
more extravagantly fond.</p>

<p>As my years increased, I was transferred from
the preparatory school, at which I had been first
placed, to a respectable seminary in the town, one
of the best the county afforded, where I received the
rudiments of a general education, and my capacity
for learning endeared me still more to my indulgent
friends. The imprudence of my mother’s conduct
had much lessened her in the affectionate esteem of
her parents; nor did her subsequent behaviour, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
believe, tend to restore her or recommend my father
to their good opinion; so that their correspondence
grew every year less frequent, and at length settled
in a formal coldness on both sides. What may appear
more unnatural, though not uncommon, is,
that in proportion as the kindness and liberality of
my grandparents towards me increased, the affection
of my father and mother diminished; and, as
they had several children afterwards, I soon became
an object, if not of aversion, at least of indifference.
Of these children, two brothers and a sister died in
their infancy, and two sisters younger than myself
are still living.</p>

<p>Nothing worth record occurred during my continuance
in S⸺shire. I passed my hours of
relaxation, like other children, in harmless sports,
but attended with avidity to my lessons when at
school; and indeed as soon as I was capable of understanding,
my chief delight was in reading books
of an entertaining nature, from all of which I derived
more or less instruction. I even preferred this
rational amusement to the childish games of my
young companions, from which my good friends
prognosticated that I should become a great man.
I must confess that I was already a spoiled child;
but I did not abuse the indulgence I met with, by
any irregular or vicious conduct, nor did I betray
any symptoms of latent depravity, or indicate any
wicked propensities. I hope my readers will believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
this assertion when I relate by what gradations
I fell from the path of rectitude, and when I account
for the causes which actuated me to pursue a course
of dishonesty. My principal delight, when very
young, was to frequent the only bookseller’s shop
our little town afforded, where I would stand for
hours reading, or rather devouring, whatever books,
or, as my dear grandfather termed it, mental food,
I could lay hold of. There was also an old woman
who had a circulating library, consisting of about a
hundred volumes, chiefly novels, to whom I disbursed
every sixpence and shilling I received for
pocket money. My parents, indeed (for by this
term I shall in future, for brevity’s sake, call my
grandfather and grandmother, as it is from them
only I ever experienced parental affection; they, I
say) did not wholly approve of this indiscriminate
passion for reading; fearing, and indeed with reason,
as I am now convinced, that I should meet with
matter tending to vitiate a young mind (which has
been justly compared to a sheet of white paper,
open to receive and retain the first impressions),
and to inculcate romantic notions of men and manners.
Though I subscribe to the justice of this
idea in general, yet I firmly believe it was owing to
this course of reading that I very early acquired
a knowledge of the world, surprising in one so
young; and that when I soon after launched into the
ocean of life, I was on my guard against many of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the deceptions of the designing part of mankind
and enabled to avoid or defeat them. My beloved
parents, indeed, suspected not the errors to which
I was becoming daily a stronger proselyte. My
grandfather, whom I believe to have been as perfect
a character and as good a Christian as nature
ever formed, inculcated both by precept and example,
the love and practice of piety and virtue;
and, above all, an inflexible adherence to honesty.
He possessed many peculiarities of habit as well as
principle, several of which I inherit from him;—would
to Heaven I inherited his virtues!</p>

<p>My volatile disposition was early manifested by
my want of stability or steady application to any
particular employment or pursuit. Like Robinson
Crusoe, I felt a strong predilection for rambling
into foreign countries, and had a longing desire to
go to sea. This arose from perusing the Voyages
of Cooke, Anson, and other circumnavigators; so
enraptured was I with their profession, that before
I was twelve years old I had a pretty just notion of
nautical manœuvres, without having ever seen a
ship, and had most sea-terms at my tongue’s end.
This rising inclination was, however, checked for a
time by the dissuasions of my friends, who were
alarmed at the bare thought of it, and by the inland
situation of the county we resided in. Among my
domestic amusements I practised drawing, for which
I had a good natural genius; but happening to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
furnished with some prints of running horses for
imitation, and being a great admirer of that noble
animal, I suddenly turned my whole attention to this
subject, in which I soon became a pretty good proficient,
considering my youth and that I never had any
master, and it appears to have been my <i>forte</i>. These
prints having always the pedigree and performances
of the animal subjoined, insensibly gave me a passion
for racing, which became my next hobby-horse. I
now eagerly perused the <i>Racing Calendar</i>, took in the
<i>Sporting Magazine</i>, purchased a <i>Stud-Book</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; and
was so indefatigable in my researches, that, before I
was fourteen, I could repeat the pedigree of any
celebrated horse, and could discourse of handicaps,
and give-and-take plates, of the <i>Beacon Course</i>, and
the <i>Devil’s Ditch</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, with the fluency of a veteran
jockey—and I actually stole a march from London
to Newmarket in hopes of obtaining a situation in
the racing stables; flattering myself that I might,
like the great Dennis O’Kelly<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, whose life I had
read, become in time a shining character on the turf;
but I failed in this attempt to disgrace my friends,
and degrade myself, as my youth and genteel appearance
deterred the persons to whom I applied from
listening to my request.</p>

<p>I shall now resume the thread of my narrative.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
After six years’ residence at S⸺, my grandfather
was prevailed on, by the solicitations of my
father and mother, to return to London, and reside
with them. My father, from whom I probably derived
my disposition to instability, had by this time
quitted the service of Sir Richard Hill, and established
himself in the hat and hosiery business in
Great Turnstile, Holborn. How this chimerical
project occurred to him, I know not, as he certainly
had been bred to no trade; however, he was sanguine
in his hopes of success. He had taken a good
house and shop, and on our arrival in town, we
found the family very comfortably established. I
was introduced to my two surviving sisters, who
were pretty, lively girls, and my father and mother
received me with a shew of great affection.</p>

<p>I was now turned of nine years old, and shortly
after our arrival, was placed by my grandfather at a
respectable boarding-school at Stockwell, in Surrey,
and my sisters were soon afterwards settled by their
father at one equally genteel at Oakingham, in
Berkshire. As I shall not have occasion to say
much more of these girls, I shall now briefly observe
that they received a good female education, learning
French and the other fashionable accomplishments
of the age. Their capacities were good; they were
both more than agreeable in their persons, and their
dispositions uncommonly sweet.</p>

</div>

<p>I continued at Stockwell nearly three years,
during which time I acquired a tolerable knowledge
of the classics, and became as perfect in the French
language as I could do without residing in France.
It was a custom at this school to allow of no English
being spoken, except in the hours devoted to
instruction, by which means our progress in French
was much facilitated. The scholars had free access
to a well-selected library, by which means I
gratified my passion for reading, which increased
with my years. I was particularly fond of plays,
and fancying I possessed some talents for the stage,
I actually formed the design, in conjunction with a
youth of good family, to elope from the school and
join a company of strollers, with the manager of
whom he had formed an acquaintance in London;
but this hopeful scheme was frustrated by the young
gentleman’s sudden removal to the University. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
was now taken from school, the excessive fondness
of my dear parents not being able to brook a longer
separation from me. I found these kind benefactors
in private lodgings, they having quitted my father’s
house on account of family disagreements.
The latter had relinquished the hat business, by
which he was <i>minus</i> some hundreds of pounds;
and after a short lapse of time, he embarked in a
very different trade, that of a tallow-chandler, of
which he had conceived favourable ideas: in this
too, he failed of success, and was equally unfortunate
in several subsequent speculations, by which
means he considerably impoverished himself; however
he continued to maintain appearances with tolerable
credit until his decease. I shall now take
leave of my father, mother, and sisters, for the present,
their history having no further connexion with
my own life, as I never again became an inmate of
their family.</p>

<p>After a short residence in ⸺ square, my
grandfather, on account of his wife’s declining health,
and with a view to economy in house-keeping, that
he might be more liberal in his bounty to myself,
thought fit to remove to Wisbeach in Cambridgeshire,
where an old schoolfellow of his resided, who
had strongly pressed this measure. Here he took
a neat little house ready furnished, and placed me
under the tuition of a clergyman in the town, whose
school I attended daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>At the end of twelve months, we again returned
to London, and soon afterwards removed once
more to S⸺shire, in the 14th year of my age.</p>

<p>I was most affectionately received by all my relations,
and it was now considered time to consult
upon my future disposal. My kind grandfather,
who had been at so much care and expense in my
education, had always intended me for one of the liberal
professions, and, as was most natural, he would
have preferred his own. I had a great uncle who had
been a very eminent surgeon and apothecary, in
which business he was succeeded by his son, who
is still living in credit at S⸺. It was in contemplation
to have me articled to this gentleman, but
I wished for a more active employment, and should
have preferred the army or navy. The dangers attending
these honourable professions, were however
insuperable bars to the consent of my fond parents.</p>

<p>At this juncture a most advantageous and unexpected
offer of patronage was extended in my behalf,
which but for my unaccountable obstinacy,
would have been thankfully embraced; but my
evil genius rendered abortive a design, which bade
fair to procure me an honourable rank in society.
The case was as follows: Within a mile of our
little town resided John Moultrie, Esq., whose father
was governor of a British Settlement in North
America, and of whose name frequent mention is
made in the history of the ill-fated war with that<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
country. By his attachment to the cause of loyalty,
this gentleman, as well as his son, suffered considerable
losses in their private property, for which in
common with many others, Governor Moultrie, on his
return to England, received a liberal pecuniary compensation
from ministers. The old gentleman was
at this period lately deceased, and his son John succeeded
to a large fortune, and a fine estate and mansion-house
called Aston, which his father had purchased
in the situation above described. He had
married a very beautiful and accomplished woman,
born in America, by whom he had an only son about
my own age, who was like myself the darling of his
parents. This youth (named Austin) had been my
early schoolfellow and playmate; and the Moultrie
family being in the habit of exchanging visits with
most of the respectable inhabitants of S⸺,
among which class my relations were numbered, I
became known to them. As they perceived a
growing attachment between myself and the young
Austin, and my manners pleased them, my visits
were encouraged, and I was almost a constant guest
at Aston Hall. By the circle of genteel persons of
both sexes with whom I there associated, my address
was improved as well as my understanding.
Young Moultrie and myself became inseparable; we
were constant companions in the chase and other
rural sports; and when the weather was unfavourable,
Mrs. Moultrie took delight in hearing me read<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
her favourite authors, to which she obliged her son
to attend; and as I had rather the advantage in
mental acquirements, she was pleased to say that I
contributed to his improvement. In a word, I may
truly assert that the happiest moments of my life
were spent in this amiable family.</p>

<p>At the period of which I am now writing, the parents
of my young friend had determined on settling
him at the University of Oxford, in order to complete
his education: and the regret they felt at parting
with their beloved child, was scarcely more
poignant than that of the latter, at his approaching
separation from me, so ardent was our juvenile
friendship. In this state of affairs, his father knowing
my situation, and the circumstances of my
grandfather, who by his liberality towards me, had
much impaired his private fortune, which consisted
at his retirement, of but a few thousand pounds stock
in the 3 per cent consols, a considerable part of
which he had sold out at a very disadvantageous rate,
by reason of the great depression in stocks at the
commencement of the French war: knowing all this,
and that my settlement in life was at this moment
the subject of much perplexity, Mr. Moultrie, with
a most unparalleled generosity, offered to place me
at college on the same terms with his son, and at the
end of three years, if he then withdrew the latter, to
take upon himself the charge of my future fortune.
Here was an offer from a gentleman of 2,000<i>l.</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
year! I have always been of Shakspeare’s opinion,
that “There is a tide in the affairs of men,” <i>&amp;c.</i>,
and that most men have not only one, but several
opportunities of attaining honour and prosperity.
I know this has been my own case, but my ill destiny
has hitherto rendered such chances unavailing.
I have unhappily neglected to “take the current
while it served.” So, in the present instance, having
foolishly conceived, that to be immured within the
walls of a college for several years, would deprive
me for so long a time of the gratifications I expected,
both of mind and body, on making my
débût on the stage of life, when I should be released
from the constraint of parental authority; the idea of
losing so much valuable time, which I fancied I
could employ to much more advantage, induced me
to protest in strong terms against the measure proposed;
and my too indulgent parents at last gave
way to my puerile remonstrances, and declined with
the best grace they could the kindness intended me.
This impolitic step was much censured by my
other relations, particularly two maiden aunts, from
whom I had great pecuniary expectations; however
it was soon after, consented to by all parties, that I
should be sent on trial, or as it is called, on liking,
to a respectable mercantile concern at Liverpool.
The parties were Messrs. Swan and Parker, very
eminent linen-drapers, who besides an extensive retail
trade, exported very largely to the East and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
West Indies, <i>&amp;c.</i> A cousin of mine had been
placed with these gentlemen a few years before, but
from ill health was obliged to return to his friends
at S⸺. His father, the junior Mr. Yonge I
have before mentioned, had paid one hundred guineas
with him as a premium; and as the young man’s indisposition
prevented him from reaping the benefit
of his engagement, Messrs. Swan and Parker very
handsomely consented to take me as an apprentice
without any fee, by way of remuneration to the family.
My grandfather indeed did not much relish
the idea of a yard and a pair of scissors; he had
fondly hoped to see me profit by the education I
had received, in a very different line of life; but as
I seconded the general wish of my friends on this
occasion, and much time had been already lost in
deliberation, all opposition ceased; and I accordingly
set out well equipped with all necessaries, by
the stage coach for Liverpool, where, on my arrival,
I was kindly received by my new masters: and the
next day instructed in the nature of my duty, and
the economy and rules of the house. Having now
brought the reader to an epoch in my life, which
promised considerable advantage to my future prospects,
I shall put an end to the second Chapter.</p>

<p>I was, now turned of fourteen; my health and
constitution good, my spirits elevated, and I felt all
those pleasing sensations, which naturally arise in a
youthful mind, happy in conscious innocence, and
flattered by the prospect of rising to honourable
independence. The gaiety and bustle of this beautiful
and improving borough at once charmed and
amused me; I spent a week in viewing the public
buildings, the environs, <i>&amp;c.</i>; but above all, my admiration
was excited by the numerous and capacious
docks, by which ships of large burden are
admitted, as it were, into the heart of the town, and
discharge their rich and varied cargoes with surprising
facility, which are deposited in spacious
warehouses, of amazing extent, and from twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to fourteen stories high, with which these noble
docks are nearly surrounded.</p>

<p>The opportunities I had, during my residence
in Liverpool, of viewing the daily arrivals and sailings
of merchant-ships to and from all parts of the
world, particularly the Guineamen, which formed a
remarkably fine class of vessels<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, revived the latent
desire I had for a sea-faring life; and I wanted but
little incitement, had the smallest opportunity offered,
to take French leave of my masters, and gratify my
rambling propensity. However, the bustle in which
I was continually involved, and the new scenes of
amusement which every succeeding day presented,
suppressed the inclination for a time; but that it
was not totally subdued, will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>The establishment and economy of our house
were upon the most regular plan; the former consisted
of six apprentices, (including myself,) and
four assistants at very liberal stipends, besides a
nephew of the elder partner, who superintended the
whole, and officiated in the compting-house: there
were also several porters, and other subordinates,
for all of whom full employment was found. Being
the junior apprentice, it was my province to polish
the counters, trim the lamps, carry out small
parcels, and to perform other inferior duties; when
disengaged from which, I assisted in waiting on the
retail customers, and making myself otherwise useful<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
behind the counter. We had a plentiful table
appropriated for us, to which we retired in turn
during the hours of business; commodious and airy
chambers; and, in short, enjoyed every comfort we
could desire.</p>

<p>For the first month of my probation, I behaved
extremely well, and by my quickness and assiduity,
gained the good opinion of my employers, who
wrote of me in the most favourable terms to my
friends in S⸺shire; nor did my expenses exceed
my allowance for pocket-money, which was fully
adequate to every rational enjoyment.</p>

<p>Among my fellow apprentices, was a young man
named King, some years older than myself, with
whom, from a similarity of sentiments, I formed a
close intimacy. He was of an excellent disposition,
but a great lover of pleasure; and as his
servitude was far advanced, and his prospects peculiarly
flattering, he was under very little restraint,
but gave the rein to his passion for dissipation.
His expenses were profuse, but whether he indulged
in them at the expense of his probity, I
could never ascertain. He soon introduced me to
several young men of his own stamp, and I became
in a short time as great a rake as the best of them:
nor was our conversation confined to our own sex;
scarcely a night passing without our visiting one or
other of those houses consecrated to the Cyprian
goddess, with which the town of Liverpool abounds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
In such a course of life, it is not likely that I
could submit to limited hours; my companion and
I seldom returned home before midnight, and sometimes
not till the ensuing morning. Though we
took measures to keep this from the ears of our
employers, it could not fail to be known in time;
and the consequence was, a strong but tender remonstrance
on my imprudence, which much affected
me at the moment; but the impression was
transitory, and soon effaced. I plunged deeper and
deeper in the vortex of folly and dissipation, until I
was obliged to have recourse for advice to the
Æsculapius of Gilead-house.</p>

<p>This irregular mode of life had borne hard on my
finances, but I had not, as yet, had recourse to fraud
or peculation. I was liberally supplied by my relations,
on leaving S⸺, and had received my first
quarterly allowance; but an event, which soon followed,
tempted me to the first breach of confidence
and integrity.</p>

<p>I had in my youth been passionately fond of
Cocking, a sport for which the county of S⸺
has been always famed; and though so young, I
had constantly kept several cocks at walk, unknown
to my parents; so that I had acquired a considerable
share of experience and knowledge on the subject.
One day, when I was sent with some muslins
to wait on a lady in the environs of Liverpool, near
the Canal, I accidentally passed a cockpit, where a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
great crowd was assembled; and I understood that
a grand Main was about to commence. Elated at
this pleasing intelligence, I hastened to execute my
commission; and returning to the house, entered it,
and leaving my wrapper of goods in care of the
landlady, I ascended to the pit, and took my seat.
The company was, as usual, of a motley description,
but there were many genteel persons. I ventured
a few trifling bets at first with various success; but
at length an opportunity offering, which I considered
as next to a certainty, I laid the odds to a large
amount, flattering myself that by this stroke of
judgment, I should be enabled to figure away with
increased eclat among my gay companions. After
I had so done, greater odds were still vociferated,
but in a moment the scene was changed! the fallen
cock, in the agonies of death, made a desperate
effort, and rising for a moment, cut the throat of
his antagonist, who was standing over him, in the
act of crowing with exultation on his victory! The
latter immediately fell, choked with the effusion of
blood, nor did the victor survive him many moments.
The whole pit resounded with acclamations, and
the discord which ensued beggars description. I
was not the only sufferer by this revolution of fortune;
many others had laid higher odds than myself,
and to a much greater amount. I was soon surrounded
by my creditors, to whom I disbursed every
shilling I had about me, among which were some<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
pounds I had just received from the lady for goods,
and for which I had given her a receipt. I was
still something deficient, for which I pledged my
honour to one of the parties, giving my address, and
promising payment on an early day. I now returned
home, filled with remorse and shame; but as the
first false step of a young person insensibly leads to
another, I added to my guilt by concealing the
affair from my employers, and directed them to book
the articles the lady had selected. I had a degree
of false shame about me, which rendered me incapable
of confessing the truth and promising
amendment, or all might still have been well. In the
evening I had recourse to the bottle to drown my
chagrin; and I determined to purloin a certain sum
every day, in the course of my attendance on retail
customers until I had liquidated my debt of honour!
Then, I vowed to stop and reform. Delusive idea!
how little did I then know my own weakness, or the
futility of such resolutions in a young mind! And
who, that once begins a career of vice, can say to
himself, “Thus far will I go, and no farther?” After
I had discharged my engagement, I found a small
sum must be raised for pocket-money, and other
exigencies, as it would be above two months before
I could expect a remittance.</p>

<p>I therefore continued my peculation, and at length
my evil genius suggested to me, that I might, by
venturing a small sum, become more fortunate at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the cockpit, and repair the loss I had sustained; as
miracles don’t happen every day, and the odds must
win in the long run. Thus I argued with myself;
and, fatally for me, I tried the experiment.</p>

<p>From this moment I never missed a day’s fighting
at the cockpit; and when sent on business which
required my speedy return, I could not tear myself
from the spot, but frequently staid out several hours,
and afterwards forged a lie to account for my delay.
I sometimes came off a winner, but as I was not
then acquainted with the art of hedging, by which
the knowing ones commonly save themselves, I
was sure to be a loser at every week’s end.</p>

<p>I managed matters so well, indeed, that my frequent
secretions from the till, were not discovered,
however they might be suspected. The extensive
trade of the shop rendered it next to impossible;
and what I abstracted, was a trifle compared to
the gross receipts of the day.</p>

<p>My continued misconduct became now the subject
of frequent remonstrances on the part of Mr.
Parker the resident partner; which not having the
desired effect, that gentleman wrote to my friends,
informing them in general terms, that I had unhappily
formed improper connexions, and that my
late levity of conduct rendered me unfit to be received
into their house; therefore, desiring I might be
recalled without delay. Mr. Parker concluded with
a remark, which I shall never forget, and which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
peculiarly gratifying to my grandfather’s (perhaps
too partial) feelings: after expatiating on my
general capacity for business, he added “his smartness
and activity are really wonderful.” This
letter produced a speedy answer, in consequence of
which, I was directed to hasten my departure, which
took place in a few days, Mr. Parker giving me
a great deal of wholesome advice at parting; observing
that although it was not in his power to
charge me with any direct criminality, my inconsiderate
behaviour, and the continued excesses of
my conduct, left but too much room for unfavourable
conjectures.</p>

<p>Behold me now returned to my grandfather, after
an absence of nearly five months; and this excursion
may be called my first entrance into life. I
could not help blushing at the consciousness of my
own unworthiness; but the blind partiality of my
dear parents, induced them to believe me less culpable
than I really was; and to listen readily to
any thing I had to offer in palliation of my errors.</p>

</div>

<p>Shortly after my return from Liverpool, finding
the narrow limits of a small market-town too
circumscribed for my active disposition; and nothing
having been determined on, as to my future
disposal, I entreated my parents to let me go to
London, which I had always considered as the
grand field for talents of every description; and
where I doubted not of forwarding myself, by the
exercise of those I possessed. They at length consented,
and after the necessary preparations, I set
out, receiving the blessings and prayers of these indulgent
benefactors, and moderately supplied with
money for my reasonable necessities.</p>

<p>My grandfather had of course many acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in London, of his own profession, to several of whom
he furnished me with letters of recommendation; it
being his wish, that I should by a few months’ practice
in a law office, ascertain how far I was disposed
to be articled for the usual period, necessary to procure
my admission. I had always been prepossessed
in favour of this profession, which I knew
from my reading and experience, to abound in variety,
and, if I may be allowed the phrase, in pleasing
perplexity.</p>

<p>On my arrival in town, I waited first on a relation
of our family, Mr. P⸺, a young man lately
established in the profession, and received as a partner
by Mr. M⸺, a gentleman of large fortune, and
extensive practice, who would, it was probable, in
a few years’ time, retire from business in favour of
my cousin.</p>

<p>The latter received me very kindly, and without
hesitation, offered to employ me (with his partner’s
concurrence) as copying clerk, at a weekly
salary, which to a youth like me, was of course but
small.</p>

<p>As I conceived this offer too advantageous to be
rejected, I thankfully embraced it, and immediately
entered on my function in Lincoln’s-Inn New
Square.</p>

<p>As I had no motives of affection to attract me to
my father’s house, I determined on becoming master
of my own conduct; and accordingly took a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
neat private lodging, and regulated my mode of
life conformably to the state of my finances. I
breakfasted at home, dined at a tavern or genteel
eating-house, and in the evening took my tea and
read the papers at a coffee-house: after which I
sometimes passed the night in reading at home, but
most commonly went to one of the theatres at half-price,
where I gratified my violent passion for the
drama, which at once improved my understanding
and amused my mind.</p>

<p>This course of life, though it rapidly weakened
my purse, was rational, compared to that which
I soon after led, and I might have supported it
with credit, by the indulgence of my friends, for
a considerable time. As the business of our office
was of a various nature, I soon gained great
experience in the different branches of common
law, and conveyancing: I became by practice,
an expert and correct copyist; and I delighted
much in studying the most approved law books,
reading reports of cases, <i>&amp;c.</i> I became familiar
with <i>Burn’s Justice</i>, and soon gained a pretty
correct knowledge of the criminal law, and of those
minute points, of which an able counsel or attorney
can avail himself, in order to rescue a client from
the claws of justice, howsoever glaring and palpable
his guilt may be. Such is the glorious uncertainty
of the English law! Little did I then conceive
how useful this knowledge might one day prove to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
myself; of which more hereafter. I merely pursued
this intricate study by way of exercising my ingenuity
and gratifying my curiosity.</p>

<p>I must here inform the reader, that these various
pursuits and studies were not confined to the short
term of my continuance in the employ of which I
am now writing. After I quitted the office of
Messrs. M⸺ and P⸺, and during the
course of a wild and dissipated life, they formed one
of my favourite domestic amusements; as did in
fact reading in general: and throughout the most
profligate stages of my future career, which I shall
hereafter narrate, a portion of my time was always
devoted to the perusal of books, and a part of my
money, however hardly or dishonestly obtained, to
the purchase of them: and to this moment I still
consider them the most valuable property a man of
my disposition can possess.</p>

<p>About three months after my arrival in town, I
began to grow less regular in my manner of life; my
expenses increased; and I became negligent of the
office hours. I had contracted an intimacy with
several young persons of both sexes, which unavoidably
engaged me in a course of expensive dissipation,
to which my means were inadequate.
Though I occasionally derived small supplies from
my grandfather, yet as he had no idea of the extent
of my expenditure, they were comparatively trifling.
Mr. P⸺ finding I was not to be reclaimed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
advice, and having no authority to use any other
means, at length for the credit of his office, and for
fear I should contaminate the other clerks, gave me
a formal, though civil dismissal, which I received
without surprise, as I knew I had long deserved it.</p>

<p>I was now tired of the law, or rather of the restraint
I was under, in an office of that description;
but still I found it necessary to have some employment,
as well to amuse me, as to contribute to my
support.</p>

<p>I therefore engaged myself as assistant in the
warehouse of Messrs. Key and Sons, wholesale stationers
in Abchurch-lane, Lombard-street, at a
weekly salary of one guinea; which was more by
half than I had received from my last employers,
and equal to the pay of an experienced clerk in an
attorney’s office at that time of day. This situation
I obtained through the interest of one of my fellow-rakes,
the son of a substantial citizen, who roundly
vouched for my integrity and diligent conduct. My
employment here was to superintend the packing of
goods for exportation and home consumption; to
write invoices; copy letters; ship goods at the Custom-house,
<i>&amp;c.</i> I continued, however, but a short
time in this situation; confinement to the east
end of the town prevented my associating with my
old acquaintances, who chiefly dwelt in the environs
of Covent-garden, or the purlieus of Drury-lane.</p>

<p>During an abode of ten months in London, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
was frequently pushed for money, I availed myself
of a genteel appearance, and pretty good address,
and taking advantage of the credulity of several tradesmen
in the neighbourhood, I ordered wearing apparel
of various kinds, and sometimes other goods, upon
credit, without much concern about the day of payment;
however I always took care to procure a
bill of parcels with the articles, which precluded
any charge of fraud, and left the matter at the worst
but a debt contracted; for which, being a minor,
I knew I could not be arrested. This was my first
deviation from honesty, since I left Liverpool. I
was also frequently obliged to change my lodgings;
and, as payment of my rent would have required
ready money, for which I had so many other uses, I
commonly decamped under favour of the night,
having previously removed my effects by various
stratagems. As I was ashamed to let my grandfather
know the true state of my affairs, and as I
really grieved at the expenses I had already caused
him, which I knew had much inconvenienced him,
I forbore at last, to trouble him for remittances;
but falsely assured him that I was doing well, and
enabled to live upon the profits of my industry. I
desired he would abandon the idea of articling me
to the law, as the expenses attending admission had
of late years been so much increased by stamp duties;
and as I could, if I continued the study, at a
future period, practise under the sanction of another<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
person’s name; a custom then very prevalent,
though irregular. By these assurances I quieted
the good old man, and silenced any inquiries my
friends might have instituted respecting me; as I now
really wished to continue free from all restraint upon
my person or actions, and foolishly flattered myself
that I should by some lucky event, ultimately secure
the means of independence. These conjectures
were, however, perfectly vague, and proceeding
from no fixed idea whatever.</p>

<p>On quitting my city employment, I returned to
the law, for which I still retained a partiality; and
obtained a more liberal salary than before in an
office equally respectable. Indeed I was now become
more useful, and had improved much both
in person and address since my arrival in town.</p>

<p>I was still frequently reduced to pecuniary straits,
and obliged to have recourse to various expedients,
known only to men of the town, for my support:
some of them indeed were bordering on dishonesty,
and none of them very honourable. But to describe
them individually, is impossible, and a man
<i>who lives by his wits</i>, as the phrase is, will assure
you, if called to account, that he really could not
for his life, tell by what distinct means he makes out
a living.</p>

<p>As I now wrote uncommonly fast, I quitted the
station of a weekly clerk, and obtained writings to
copy by the sheet, from the law stationers, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
I could earn considerably more money; and in
this employment I continued to labour diligently
for several hours every day, and sometimes half the
night.</p>

<p>When I had a mind to relax from this occupation,
and particularly if my finances were at a low ebb, I
frequently resorted to the Blue Lion, in Gray’s-Inn-Lane,
a house noted for selling fine ale, and crowded
every night with a motley assemblage of visiters,
among whom were many thieves, sharpers and other
desperate characters, with their doxies. I was introduced
to this house (from which hundreds of
young persons may date their ruin) by a fellow-clerk,
who appeared to have a personal intimacy with most
of these obnoxious persons; however, though I listened
eagerly to their conversation, (part of which was
then unintelligible to me), and fancied them people
of uncommon spirit, I was not yet sufficiently depraved
to cultivate their acquaintance; but sat with
a pipe in my mouth, enveloped in smoke, ruminating
like a philosopher on the various characters
who tread the great stage of life, and felt a sort of
secret presentiment, that I was myself born to undergo
a more than common share of vicissitudes
and disappointments. How far these ideas were
well grounded, the reader will judge when he has
perused this narrative, of which I shall here close
the fourth Chapter.</p>

<p class="short"><i>The Trip to Portsmouth.</i></p>

</div>

<p>During my nightly resorts to the Blue Lion,
in Gray’s-Inn-Lane, I one evening fell into conversation,
at that house, with a young man of decent
appearance, a few years older than myself. We
were so mutually pleased with each other, that at
parting, an appointment to breakfast together the
next morning was the consequence, and on this
second meeting, our intimacy so far increased, that
we began to explain our respective situations in life
to each other. My new acquaintance, whose name
was D⸺, informed me that he had lately quitted
His Majesty’s Ship Montague, of 74 guns, on
board of which he had served as Steward to the
Commander, Captain Patterson. That having
lived freely for some months on shore, he had now
spent all his money, and was so much reduced,
that he really knew not how to subsist any longer,
and concluded with expressing his intention to
proceed immediately to Portsmouth, in the hope of
obtaining a similar birth to his former one. I
assured him that I was, like himself, so much reduced,
as to find the utmost difficulty in existing at
all, and that if he would permit me to join my fortune<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to his, I should without hesitation feel happy
in the opportunity of accompanying him to Portsmouth
in quest of some employment. He declared
that nothing would afford him greater pleasure, and
it was agreed that we should, each of us without
delay, convert our spare apparel, <i>&amp;c.</i>, into cash,
and set out the very next day. I accordingly lost
no time in the needful preparations, and having
bilked my landlord, with whom I was some few
weeks in arrears, I met D⸺, the same evening,
and after indulging in a farewell cruize, which
sensibly diminished our slender finances, we took
a few hours’ repose, and at eight o’clock the next
morning, commenced our peregrination.</p>

<p>On a comparison of our personal effects, it appeared
that we possessed between us about twenty
shillings in money, and had each a spare shirt, neck-cloth
and hose, in a bundle, which (traveller-like)
we carried across our shoulders on a good oak-stick.
We were both decently clad, in good health, and in
high spirits notwithstanding our poverty. We agreed
that to save expenses, we should perform the journey
on foot, (being seventy-two miles) and we calculated
that with frugality, we should be enabled to defray
the contingent charges for diet and lodging on the
road. It soon appeared, however, that though good
economists in theory, we were not so in practice; for
as we both loved good cheer, and the severity of
the weather required a suitable fortification, we had<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
expended half our stock by the time we got to
Kingston, our first stage, and only twelve miles
from town. Here we put up at a public-house,
called The Eight Bells, and having enjoyed a
good dinner, which was succeeded by some excellent
mulled elder wine of the landlady’s own composition,
and which was peculiarly adapted to the
season of the year, we liked our quarters so well
that we spent not only the night, but half the next
day in the enjoyments of repose, eating, drinking,
and smoking, before it occurred to either of us that
every item of those said enjoyments was recorded in
chalk by the hostess, and would inevitably be consolidated
in the shape of a bill, which we must
discharge before a clearance could be obtained
for the next port. Having at length recollected
ourselves, and called “to pay,” our reckoning
amounted to three or four shillings more than we
possessed in our common purse. As it was impossible
to think of proceeding any farther without
recruiting, we were now in no small consternation.
Bilking the landlady was out of the question, for
we had given our bundles into her charge on first
entering the house, and their contents were not only
indispensably necessary to us, but also worth more
than the sum required to release them. In this
dilemma, a sudden thought struck me. Calling for
pen, ink, and paper, I told my companion I had a
scheme in my head for raising a supply, but would<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
not impart it until I had tried its success. I then
drew up a sort of Memorial to the following effect:
“To the Ladies and Gentlemen of Kingston.—The
writer hereof, a young man of respectable
family, and good education, having by a series of
misfortunes, been reduced to the greatest distress,
is now on his way to Portsmouth, in hopes of procuring
a situation in the navy; but being destitute of
money for his present support, humbly solicits your
charitable assistance towards enabling him to pursue
his journey. To a noble mind, the pleasure of
doing a good action is its own reward. The smallest
donations will be gratefully received, and any
lady or gentleman inclined to relieve the writer is
earnestly requested to subscribe his or her name
hereto.”—Having completed this production, I
desired my friend to wait patiently for my return,
and assured him I doubted not of bringing speedy
relief. I now set out on my expedition, and immediately
waited on Mr. Mayor, who was a grocer, but
in this first essay I was unsuccessful. His worship
declared he never encouraged applications of this
sort from strangers; and desired me to go about
my business. I, however, took the liberty of subscribing
his name to my memorial, by way of
sanction, and gave his charity credit for a donation of
five shillings. Young as I was at that time, I well
knew that example, in matters of this kind, goes a
great way; and that many persons, without a grain<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of christian benevolence in their composition, will
give liberally from motives of ostentation, when they
see that their neighbours have already contributed,
and that their own names and donations will also be
made public. I experienced the truth of this
notion, for I was successful in almost every application
I afterwards made. Having visited a number
of genteel houses, with various success, I was on
the point of returning, to impart my good luck to
my companion, when coming to a very handsome
mansion-house in the suburbs of the town, I thought
I ought not to omit calling, and a person at that
moment passing by, I inquired whose residence it
was, and which was the entrance to the premises;
for the house was situated in the midst of a spacious
pleasure-ground, remote from the high road, and it
being quite dusk, I had not observed any avenue by
which I could gain access to it. I was informed
that it was the residence of Lady W⸺, that a
little further on, I should perceive a door in the
brick wall, which extended along the road-side, and
that if I entered at that door, and proceeded in
a strait direction, I should arrive at the servants’ hall;
but my informer cautioned me to keep close to
another wall on my left hand, which divided this
avenue from the lawn in front of the mansion,
because there was a very large and fierce dog at the
upper end, but which, being chained up, could not
reach me, if I followed the above directions. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
thanked this obliging person, and immediately proceeded
to the door described, which I entered, and
walked cautiously, and not without some fear, by the
wall-side, till I perceived by the lights in the kitchen,
and out-offices, that I was near the premises.</p>

<p>It was now very dark, and I was carefully exploring
my way, my mind full of apprehensions at
the thought of this terrible dog; when lo! at that
instant, to my inexpressible consternation, the
ferocious animal made a spring at me, and I gave
myself up for dead. However, though he was certainly
within a yard of me, he did me no mischief,
but my alarm was so great, that without knowing
how, or where to fly for refuge, I ran precipitately
from the spot, and when I recovered from the
fright, found myself in the pleasure-ground in front
of the mansion-house. It appeared that I had,
without knowing, escaped through a door in the
wall, which was open on my left hand at the moment
I was alarmed by the dog. I was now more at a
loss than ever, for I knew of no way to get out of the
pleasure-ground, except by the aforesaid door, and
fear of the dog prevented my attempting that
passage. After wandering about for a few minutes,
I approached the mansion, and going up to one of
the parlour windows, which were very large, and
on a level with the terrace before the house, I applied
my eye to the glass, and discovered through an
aperture in the inside shutters, a numerous and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
splendid party of ladies and gentlemen at dinner.
Having considered a moment, I determined on a
very bold step, as I saw no alternative but remaining
all night in the open air, exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. Taking advantage of a
pause in the company’s conversation, I tapped with
my finger at the window, and immediately the whole
party were struck with wonder. In the midst of
their surprise I repeated my knock, and then, after
several voices exclaiming, “Good God! there is
certainly somebody at the window,” <i>&amp;c.</i>, a gentleman
rose from the table, and advancing towards me,
opened first the shutters, and then the window itself,
which might, in fact, be called a pair of folding
doors, and these being thrown back, I walked in
with the most respectful air I could assume, and
presented myself to the astonished company.
Having bowed twice or thrice, and given time for
their alarm to subside, I began to make my speech.</p>

<p>Apologizing for my presumptuous intrusion, I
stated in a concise manner, the fright I had endured,
from the dog, my embarrassment at not being able
to find means of egress from the pleasure-ground,
and my having consequently taken the liberty of
knocking at the window. I then presented my
memorial, which was read in turn by most of the
company, each of whom surveyed me with evident
surprise. Having answered such queries as they
thought proper to put to me, I was desired by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
lady of the house to withdraw to the kitchen for a
short time, and a servant was ordered to attend me
thither. Here I had my story to repeat for the
information of the domestics, who laughed heartily
at the adventure of the dog, but afterwards seriously
assured me, that had the animal not been chained,
or had I approached within his reach, he would
inevitably have torn me to pieces. The parlour
dinner being over, and the dishes brought out, I
was desired to fall to, and being really hungry I
wanted no pressing, but selected from the variety
of good things on the table a very fine buttock of
beef, on which substantial fare I made a sumptuous
meal. There was no scarcity of good malt liquor,
and Lady W⸺ very kindly sent me out a pint of
red port, with a particular injunction (which by-the-by
was unnecessary,) that I should eat and drink
heartily.</p>

<p>At length I was summoned to attend the company
in the parlour, and her ladyship then expressing
her concern for my misfortunes, and her anxious
hope that I should speedily find an end to them,
presented me with half-a-guinea. The rest of the
party also said many handsome things, and the
majority of them contributed to my relief. In addition
to these favours, one of the gentlemen, at the
particular request of Lady W⸺, took the trouble
to write a letter in my behalf to the captain of a
man-of-war, supposed to be then lying at Portsmouth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
entreating him to give me an appointment
under him. Her Ladyship, after obliging me to
take another glass of wine, and repeating her sorrow
for my distress, advised me to lose no time in prosecuting
my journey, ordered a servant to conduct
me to the door at which I had first entered her premises,
and I took a respectful leave of this truly
benevolent party.</p>

<p>Returning to the Eight Bells, I imparted my adventures
to my friend, who was, of course, much
pleased at my success, for I had realized between
four and five pounds. I found this begging scheme
so productive, that I was in no hurry to pursue the
Portsmouth speculation, and as we were both satisfied
with our present quarters, it was agreed that we
should continue a few days longer in Kingston, in
which time I proposed to follow up my success by
making a regular circuit among the inhabitants; and
I, in fact, determined to levy similar contributions in
every town which lay in our route.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that this idea of raising
money was perfectly original in me, for at that time
I had never heard of such a practice, but have since
discovered that it is a very common expedient,
and is called by those persons who live by such
impositions, “<i>the Letter Racket</i>.”</p>

<p>The following day I again sallied forth, and met
with equal success, visiting not only the houses of
private persons, but even the respectable shopkeepers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
<i>&amp;c.</i>; and I may here state, once for all,
that in the course of this, as well as my subsequent
speculations of the same nature, I met with various
receptions, according to the charitable or churlish
dispositions of the people to whom I applied.
Many pitied my case and cheerfully relieved me.
Others expressed equal commiseration, but declined
giving any thing, either because “they never encouraged
beggars,” or “they had poor enough of
their own to maintain.” Some invited me into their
parlours, treated me with excessive politeness, and
obliged me to take refreshment at their own tables;
and where there were any young ladies in the family,
I was an object of particular solicitude, and the
recital of my misfortunes drew many a sigh from
their tender bosoms. Others desired me, like the
Mayor of Kingston, to go about my business, and
hinted that I ought to be sent to the house of correction
as a vagrant. Sometimes the servants who
admitted me refused to present my memorial, declaring
they had strict orders from their masters or
mistresses never to trouble them on such an occasion.
The donations I commonly received, were from one
shilling to five; sometimes, but rarely, I was presented
with gold, particularly at the seats of the
nobility and gentry, all which, laying within a short
distance of the road I travelled, I made a point of
calling at; and for my information on this subject,
I provided myself with a comprehensive book of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
roads, in which those objects are correctly laid
down. Some truly charitable persons, but whose
means were limited, relieved me with sixpence, and
of course I was bound to accept such a trifle with
as much appearance of thankfulness, as I would a
larger sum; and frequently when I called at a farm
house by the road-side, I have been compelled to
take some cold meat, or other eatables, which I
afterwards bestowed upon the first more needy
beggar I met on my way. It was my custom in
general, to travel on foot, making short stages, and
putting up at a good inn in every town I entered,
where I lived upon the best during my stay, and
associated with London riders, and other respectable
guests. When tired of walking, I availed myself
of a passing stage-coach, or return post-chaise,
and my only equipage was a spare shirt, handkerchief,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, which, with my book of roads, I carried
in a small bundle under my arm.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative, I returned from my
second day’s excursion about dusk in the evening,
and entering the Eight Bells, was surprised at not
finding my companion within. On inquiring of
the landlady, the good woman informed me, with
some degree of terror, that two of the town constables
had been in search of me; and kindly exhorted me,
if I was conscious of having done wrong, to make
the best of my way from Kingston, as she expected
them to call again every minute, adding that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
believed my friend was gone out in quest of me. I
smiled at the landlady’s fears, and thanking her for
her friendly advice, assured her I was unconscious
of any crime, and should willingly face the officers,
come when they might. I then desired to have
some tea, which she set about preparing, during
which interval my fellow-traveller came in. I
briefly concerted with him the part we should respectively
act, in case of our being called upon to
give an account of ourselves, though I had no conception
on what grounds I was to be apprehended.
We now proceeded to take our tea, but before we
had half finished it, the constables entered the room,
and informed me they had orders to carry me before
the magistrates, who were then assembled in the
town-hall; and that the young man, who they understood
to be my comrade, must also accompany me.
I answered, I would with pleasure attend them, but
requested time to finish our repast, which they consented
to allow us; and we then proceeded all together
to the town-hall, the officers carrying our two
bundles, which they had obtained from the landlady
by order of the justices. Being brought before the
bench, I immediately recognised among the persons
in attendance, one of the gentlemen I had seen at
Lady W⸺’s dinner party, and the very same who
had written the letter of recommendation to Captain ⸺.
This gentleman now stated to the magistrates
the circumstance of my coming to Lady W⸺’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
house the preceding evening, the extraordinary
manner in which I had made my appearance, and
the reception I met with; and farther stated, that
the ensuing morning, it was discovered that a part
of the fence enclosing the pleasure-ground had been
broken, and other damage done on the premises,
which led to a suspicion that I might be an impostor,
who had a design to rob the house, or do some other
mischief, and that he, therefore, on the part of Lady
W⸺, wished me to be examined by their worships,
and obliged to give some further account of myself.</p>

<p>Though the suspicions of Lady W. and her friends
appeared to have been very weakly founded, and their
idea to be utterly extravagant, the justices entered
seriously into the spirit of the business, and ordering
us to be set apart from each other, proceeded to
interrogate us strictly as to our professions, business
in Kingston, the objects of our journey, <i>&amp;c.</i> I, for
my part, adhered to the story I had before framed,
which it is needless to repeat to the reader, being
devoid of interest, and as it was for the most part
utterly false, I cannot now minutely recollect it.
My companion’s account of himself was nearer the
truth. He stated that he had been an officer’s servant
in the navy, and was now on his way to Portsmouth
in quest of a similar situation, but denied
any further knowledge of me than joining me by
accident on the road, and as I was bound to the
same place, we had agreed to keep each other company.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Our bundles being next inspected, were
found to contain nothing of a suspicious nature, except
a number of pawnbrokers’ duplicates, and these
we respectively accounted for as relating to wearing
apparel, <i>&amp;c.</i>, which our pecuniary distress had
obliged us to pledge. This part of the story was
indeed strictly true, and in my case corroborated,
and gave an air of probability to my account. Nothing
appearing to warrant the detention of my
companion, he was discharged, but with a positive
order to quit the town instantly. As to myself,
having mentioned, in answer to a query from
one of the magistrates, the name of a certain gentleman,
in London, who knew me and my family,
his worship declared he was himself intimately acquainted
with that gentleman, and as he was going
to town the next day, he should make a point of referring
to him as to the truth of my assertion. He
therefore ordered a constable to detain me in custody
until his return from London. I was accordingly
confined in the officer’s house, where I had
every necessary accommodation, for the expenses of
which the magistrate himself very kindly became
accountable. My companion visited me the same
evening, prior to his departure, and I divided with
him the money I had acquired. It was his intention
to proceed direct to Portsmouth, and I promised,
as soon as I was liberated to follow him, taking
a direction whereby to find him on my arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The ensuing evening the magistrate returned from
town, and immediately sent for me to his own house.
Being brought before his worship, who was a brewer,
named Sidebottom, I found him seated, not on
the chair of justice, but on a stool in his accompting-house.
The old gentleman began by remarking
with some severity, on the impropriety and turpitude
of my conduct, in withdrawing myself from the
protection of my respectable friends, and traversing
the country under such debasing circumstances.
He said he had understood from his friend Mr.
Howell, that my relations were both able and willing
to take care of my fortunes. After a long
expostulation to the same effect, his worship continued:
“Perhaps you are not aware that it is in my
power to commit you to bridewell for a month for
begging without a pass.” Then raising his voice
and brandishing his pen, he exclaimed with a very
pompous air, “Young man, I shall certainly⸺discharge
you.” The two latter words relieved me
from a momentary anxiety; for when his worship
paused, I certainly expected he would add “commit
you.” He proceeded, “but, on the express
condition that you immediately quit this town, and
return to your friends. If you are found hereabouts
after this night, expect to be severely dealt with.”
I gladly accepted these terms, and assuring the old
gentleman of my compliance, took a respectful
leave, his worship giving me a little more wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
advice, and generously presenting me with
half-a-crown, as he said, to carry me to London.</p>

<p>Being now discharged, I repaired to the Eight
Bells, where I settled with my landlady, and learnt
from her that my companion had left Kingston the
preceding night at a late hour, by the Portsmouth
coach. I slept this night at the Eight Bells, and
the next morning returned to London, where on my
arrival I found myself in possession of above five
pounds, after all the impediments I had met with.</p>

<p>As I made a point of keeping my word with my
late fellow-traveller, I determined on having one
jovial evening in town, and resuming my journey
the next day, by the same route as before, notwithstanding
Justice Sidebottom’s prohibition. As to
presenting myself to Mr. Howell, or going near
any of my friends, nothing was more foreign to my
thoughts.</p>

<p>The following morning, I accordingly set out on
my second expedition by the Kingston stage, and
arriving at that town, took up my lodging at a public-house
in the suburbs. Notwithstanding the
check I had before met with, I was so hardy as to
stop three days in Kingston, during which I levied
contributions on most of the inhabitants, taking care
to avoid that part of the town I had before visited,
and I was so lucky as to meet with no interruption
to my success. From Kingston I proceeded to
Guildford, taking in my way, Cobham, Ripley, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the intervening villages; from Guildford to Godalming,
thence to Liphook, where I altered my
course, and took a circuitous route by the way of
Chichester, to Portsmouth. This journey occupied
about a fortnight, and arriving at Portsmouth,
I soon found my late companion, D⸺, who
was lodged at the house of an acquaintance, and
not having yet obtained a birth on ship-board, had
engaged himself as an occasional clerk and assistant
to a tradesman in the town. I myself hired a small
apartment in St. Mary’s street, intending to remain
a week or two in Portsmouth, where I had never
before been, and to enjoy such amusements as the
place afforded, as long as my money lasted. As my
friend D⸺ appeared to have dropped the idea
of going on ship-board, I became also careless on
that subject, particularly as the motive which gave
rise to that design (namely, poverty) no longer existed,
for I was now possessed, after all the expenses
of travelling, <i>&amp;c.</i>, of about fifteen pounds.</p>

<p>I spent several days in viewing the town, dock-yard,
fleet, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and in the evening generally visited
the theatre, which was then open. About a week
after my arrival, reading the Portsmouth weekly
paper, I saw an advertisement for a clerk; and, as
I found that some means of subsistence would soon
become necessary, and it was indifferent to me in
what part of the kingdom I sojourned, I determined
to offer myself. Inquiring, as directed, of Mottley,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the bookseller, on the Parade, I was referred to
Moses Greetham, Esq., judge-advocate, also an
attorney of the first eminence. That gentleman,
without hesitation, engaged me at a guinea a week,
and I next morning commenced my attendance at
his office in High-street. About the same time, my
companion D⸺ suddenly quitted the town,
without acquainting me of his intention; and I was
informed, on inquiry, that he had gone to Southampton,
but on what speculation I never learnt,
nor did I ever afterwards see or hear more of him.</p>

<p>The nature of my new employment was very
agreeable and full of variety. Besides Mr. Greetham’s
public duties on courts-martial, and his general
practice as a solicitor, he had a great deal of
business relating to prizes, their condemnation, sale,
proceeds, <i>&amp;c.</i>; and on these occasions all the parties
concerned met in a spacious room at the Crown
inn, where an elegant dinner, with wines in abundance,
was invariably provided at the expense of
the clients. These dinners occurred three or four
times every week, and as they were afterwards succeeded
by coffee, <i>&amp;c.</i>, the expenses of living, to myself
and the other clerk of Mr. Greetham, who (as
well as the latter gentleman), always partook of the entertainment,
were considerably diminished. During
intervals, between dinner, tea, <i>&amp;c.</i>, we retired to an
adjoining room, where an hour or two was devoted
to writing depositions, examining ships’ papers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
other matters relative to the cause in question.
This was, in fact, one of the best situations I ever
met with, and, from its respectability, would, no
doubt, had I continued steady, have ultimately led
to prosperity and independence; but my evil genius
interposed to ruin this, as well as all my former
hopes of happiness.</p>

<p>The circumstance which occasioned my losing this
place was indeed very trivial, and hardly amounted
to a crime. Among the number of persons with
whom we transacted business, was a native of Holland,
who acted in many cases as an interpreter to
Mr. Greetham, on the part of those concerned in
prize causes. This man being an original, both in
person and manners, was an inexhaustible subject
of laughter to myself and fellow-clerk, who was
much older than me, and we omitted no opportunity
of indulging in mirth at his expense. As he was
not possessed of much penetration and was of a
very placid disposition, he was commonly insensible
of our jokes, or, at least, took them in good part;
but one afternoon, when we were all three taking
coffee together, the Dutchman rising from his seat
on some occasion, with a cup of boiling hot coffee
in his hand, my brother-clerk, who was just then in
a merry vein, winked at me to withdraw the interpreter’s
chair. I obeyed the signal with alacrity,
and the poor fellow, attempting to resume his seat,
was in a moment thrown keel upwards, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
he fell, received the boiling fluid full in his face.
I was so unfeelingly mischievous as to laugh immoderately
at the pain and embarrassment of the poor
Dutchman, who certainly cut a most ridiculous
figure; but my fellow-clerk, who possessed more
prudence than myself, restrained his mirth, and, with
a serious air, affected to condole with the sufferer
on his misfortune. He even carried his hypocrisy
so far as to express displeasure at the mischievous
trick I had played. I felt much indignation at his
duplicity of conduct, and regretted, when too late,
that I had suffered myself to be made the dupe of
his treachery; for I was afterwards convinced that
he was jealous of my abilities, and feared I should
supplant him in the favour of Mr. Greetham. The
consequence of this injudicious frolic was, that the
interpreter complained to my employer, who the
next morning rebuked me severely for behaving with
such unbecoming freedom towards a respectable
man in his immediate service; and, observing that
such levity of conduct rendered me unfit for his
office, Mr. Greetham presented me with a guinea, although
this was only the second day of the week, and
declared he had no further occasion for me.</p>

<p>Being now once more disengaged, I began to
think of returning to London; but, having still a
little money left, I continued about a week longer
in Portsmouth, during which time I took up my
lodging at the Blue Posts’ tavern, in Point-street,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
where I lived in the most sumptuous manner, drinking
my wine freely, and pretending that I was waiting
for the departure of the East India fleet, in
which I was going out a passenger, and that I expected
my baggage from town in a few days. I
had, while in the service of Mr. Greetham, made
several efforts to obtain clothes, <i>&amp;c.</i>, upon the credit
of my living with that gentleman; but I found the
Portsmouth tradesmen too wary to be imposed
upon, and only succeeded to a very trifling amount.
I had, however, bilked my late lodging in St. Mary’s
street, and intended playing the same trick at the
Blue Posts. Finding, at length, that the landlord
and waiters viewed me with scrutinizing eyes, and
appeared tacitly to ask for payment of my reckoning,
I left the coffee-room one evening after dinner, on
pretence of going to the play, and immediately
quitted the town, taking the road to Petersfield on
foot.</p>

<p>On arriving at the latter place, which I had
omitted in my journey downwards, by striking into
the Chichester road at Liphook, I levied a small
contribution, under the old pretext of going to
Portsmouth, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and then pursued my course to
London, where I arrived in good spirits, after an
absence of eight weeks, with about ten pounds in my
pocket, having lived well during my expedition, and
enjoyed a variety of pleasant entertainment.</p>

</div>

<p>I had continued some months in this course of
life, and was frequently reduced to very great shifts;
on these occasions I had recourse to those accommodating
persons, called pawnbrokers, who obligingly
lend money at the moderate interest of seventy-three
hundred per cent.! as has been clearly proved
in a late publication. I sometimes raised the wind
by my old expedient of obtaining goods on credit,
called in the cant language <i>maceing</i>: these I converted
into ready money for immediate purposes.
By such artifices I contrived to support a genteel
appearance, though sometimes bordering on the
shabby. My principal enjoyments, indeed, were
not of the most extravagant nature, with the exception
of theatrical amusements. I commonly spent
my evenings (if not at the Blue Lion), at some genteel<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
porter or chop-house, frequented chiefly by attornies’
clerks and the neighbouring tradesmen;
where I enjoyed a pipe and an evening paper, and
at the same time listened to the conversation of the
surrounding guests, amusing myself with their various
characters and peculiarities. I frequently
dined, from the same motives, at different ordinaries,
particularly one at the Saracen’s-Head, Snow-Hill.</p>

<p>One day, after dining at this house, I adjourned
to the coffee-room, and, seating myself in a box,
called for a glass of negus, and a daily paper. I was
soon joined by a gentleman of a very prepossessing
aspect, who I perceived, by the buttons on his coat,
to be a warrant officer in the navy. After the customary
compliments, we entered into conversation;
and he soon let me understand that he was surgeon
of a frigate called the Astræa.</p>

<p>Delighted with an opportunity of expatiating
on my favourite topic, I asked many questions
concerning the service; and the eagerness of
my manner convinced this gentleman that I had
a strong inclination to enter into it. He appeared
pleased with my vivacity of manner, and the
pertinence of my remarks; and having extracted
from me a confession of my inclinations, and a
brief account of my family and expectancies,
he, with the greatest kindness, undertook to
write in my favour to Captain Dacres, his commander,
who was then at his seat in Devonshire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the frigate being in dock at Sheerness; assuring me
there was little doubt of my obtaining a midshipman’s
birth, provided my friends would consent
to it, and fit me out in a suitable manner for the occasion.
I was in raptures at the result of this fortunate
meeting; and expressing the warmest gratitude
for such friendship shewn to an utter stranger,
assured Mr. Kennedy (for this was the surgeon’s
name), of my choice being approved by my grandfather,
who anxiously wished me to fix on some profession,
which might afford a prospect of future independence.
It was therefore settled that Mr. Kennedy
should write to the Captain without delay, and that
I should immediately entreat my grandfather to
sanction my views, and to write also to Capt. Dacres,
requesting his approbation and commands respecting
me. Mr. Kennedy further recommended that I
should, in the interim, take a trip to Sheerness, and
wait on the commanding-officer, Mr. Rowley, who
was then, with the Astræa’s crew, on board the Carolina
hulk, during the frigate’s repair. For this
end he furnished me with a line of introduction to
Lieut. Rowley, and added that he should himself be
at Sheerness, where his family resided, in a few days.
He observed that I should be much amused with
the excursion, as I had never been on board a king’s
ship, and that I should also open an acquaintance
with the young gentlemen who, in all probability,
were to be my future messmates and companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>I immediately wrote in the most pressing terms
to my grandfather, assuring him that his refusal to
ratify my choice would render me completely miserable;
but that if I was indulged in my desire, I
would never again become troublesome to any of
my friends, or betray any future signs of inconstancy
or caprice. I concluded with expressing my hopes
of his receiving a favourable answer from the captain,
and that I should in a few days have this intimation
communicated in a letter from himself, approving
of the steps I had taken.</p>

<p>Having so done, I equipped myself as handsomely
as my means would admit, and the next day set
out for Sheerness, where I arrived in high spirits,
and proceeded on board the Carolina. On presenting
my credentials to the first lieutenant, I was very
politely received, and invited to the ward-room,
where I was introduced to several other officers,
who, on learning my intentions, and that I was recommended
by the doctor, welcomed me in the
kindest terms, and highly commended my spirit.
After refreshing myself, Mr. Rowley sent for a
midshipman, whom he requested to shew me every
attention, and to introduce me to his messmates as
a person likely soon to become a brother Mid. This
young man obeyed with the greatest pleasure, and
I soon became perfectly at home. My conductor
next took me through every part of the hulk, and I
was both pleased and astonished at the novelty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the objects I met with. The hulk had been a line-of-battle
ship, and her interior was, of course, extensive
and capacious. The decks were crowded with
hucksters, who exposed provisions, fruits, and other
articles for sale. Groups of sailors with their girls
were seen dancing to the music of a fiddle or a fife;
others were engaged at cards, draughts, <i>&amp;c.</i> Grog
was every where the order of the day; but still the
most perfect regularity and cleanliness pervaded
every part of this wooden world. Having satisfied
my curiosity, I returned to the midshipmen’s birth,
which was merely a large space in the after-part of
the orlop deck, enclosed with canvass, to render it
warm and private. I obtained from these young
gentlemen a list of such clothes, books, instruments,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, as were requisite to form a genteel out-fit; and
an estimate of the probable cost of the whole, which
I found to be at least 80<i>l.</i> I now received, by the
ward-room steward, an invitation to dine with the
lieutenants, <i>&amp;c.</i> The party was increased by the
company of some ladies from the shore, and the repast
was excellent. Wit, wine, and grog, abounded,
and I now conceived I had found the sphere of life
in which I could enjoy unalloyed happiness. After
sitting a reasonable time, I expressed a wish to view
the town of Sheerness, the dock-yard, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and requested
Mr. Rowley to permit the midshipman before-mentioned
to go on shore with me. To this he
kindly assented, and ordered a boat to be manned<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
on purpose; stipulating, however, that we should return
at a reasonable hour, and that I would make
use of a spare cot, in the cabin of the third lieutenant,
who was absent on leave. My kind young
friend shewed me the objects most worthy of remark;
and we then adjourned to the Marlborough-head
inn, where we took some coffee, and about eight
o’clock returned to the hulk. My conductor, having
reported his return to the first lieutenant, wished me
good night, and I took a seat at the ward-room
table, where the party was now reduced to the first
and second lieutenants, the master, purser, and lieutenant
of marines. I now found that grog was to
be the order of the night also; but as I had never
been accustomed to that beverage, in the way they
drank it, I could not help betraying my dislike; on
which Mr. Rowley, in a good-humoured way, assured
me that I should never make a sailor without I could
learn to drink grog. I was therefore constrained to
make a glass, which I did pretty stiff, as the sailors
term it; and its inspiring qualities soon caused me
to banish all reserve. Mr. Rowley conversed
with great appearance of regard on my future prospects;
gave me a most amiable character of the
captain; and instructed me in the outlines of my
duty, as well as in the conduct I ought to pursue for
my own advantage. He informed me, the Astræa
would be undocked in about three weeks, and that
I had therefore no time to lose in equipping myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>After as pleasant and rational an evening as I ever
remember to have spent, I retired to rest in the neat
little cabin, I have before mentioned; and slept for
the first time in my life on salt-water. The next
morning, after breakfast, I had the pleasure of seeing
my worthy friend, the surgeon, who had just
arrived from town. He insisted on my dining with
himself and family ashore; I therefore took a respectful
leave of Mr. Rowley, and the other gentlemen
in the ward-room; a most cordial farewell of
my brother Mids, as I was proud to call them; and,
receiving the wishes of all parties for my speedy
return to join the ship, I accompanied Mr. Kennedy
on shore. I spent a pleasant day at his lodgings,
and in the evening set out on my return to London,
highly pleased with my excursion, and indulging the
most pleasing hopes of future happiness.</p>

<p>In a week’s time, I had the pleasure of receiving
a letter from my grandfather, wherein he informed
me that my entreaties were granted, though with
much reluctance on the part of most of my friends;
and enclosing a handsome letter from Captain Dacres,
who expressed his willingness to receive me as
a midshipman on board His Majesty’s ship Astræa,
out of respect to the recommendation of his surgeon,
and because he would not defeat the hopes of
a young man who might one day prove an ornament
to the service. My grandfather concluded with desiring
I would immediately come down to S⸺shire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
for the purpose of taking leave of my friends
and receiving the necessary sum to defray the expenses
of my equipment.</p>

<p>I obeyed this welcome summons without delay,
and, after a stay of several days at S⸺, I took
an affectionate leave of all my relatives, who could
not divest themselves of anxiety on my account;
and returned to town with nearly 100<i>l.</i> in my
pocket, my other friends having contributed liberally
to assist my grandfather in this emergency.</p>

<p>On arriving in town, I took lodgings in the New
Exchange Coffee-house in the Strand, being a
house frequented by naval officers, and to which
Lieutenant Rowley had recommended me. My
first care was to purchase a large and strong chest,
which having sent to my lodgings, I proceeded to
buy linen, bedding, uniforms, books, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>; and of
course, did not forget an elegant hanger, a dirk, and
a cocked-hat, richly bound with gold lace.</p>

<p>I was so diligent in this affair, that in ten days I
had every thing ready; and, embarking with my
luggage on board a Sheerness packet, the same day
sailed down the river Thames. After a favourable
passage, we arrived at Sheerness; and, as we passed
through the fleet, I had the pleasure of seeing my
ship lashed alongside the Carolina, having the preceding
day come out of dock. As soon as the
sloop anchored, I went on board the hulk, and was
received with kind encouragement by my superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
officers, and with the most lively pleasure by my
future messmates. Mr. Rowley very kindly sent
the cutter to bring my chest, <i>&amp;c.</i>, from the packet;
and I was then formally introduced by that gentleman
to the midshipmen’s birth. After a jovial
evening, spent in festivity and merriment, I retired
to my hammock, in which I slept well, notwithstanding
the novelty of my situation. The next
day was spent in overhauling my chest, as the young
tars termed an inspection of its contents; and I had
the pleasure to find, that my judgment and taste in
the purchases I had made, were universally approved
of. Day after day increased the happiness
I felt in my novel and respectable situation; and my
gratitude to those who were, under Providence, the
promoters of my good fortune.</p>

<p>The mess of which I was become a member,
consisted of eleven persons; namely, nine midshipmen
of different ages, the captain’s clerk, and surgeon’s
mate: the latter was a most curious character,
a Welshman named Jones; and reminded me,
on a very short acquaintance, of Morgan in <i>Roderic
Random</i>, whom he resembled in many particulars:
and I soon found that he was, like him, a kind of
butt for the others to exercise their waggery upon;
but in the main he was a good-hearted, inoffensive
young man. The captain’s clerk was a genteel
youth, who had served under his present commander
several years, and was in expectation of being soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
promoted to the rank of purser, through his interest.
Of the rest, two or three were midshipmen who
had also served nearly the limited term; one a
master’s mate, and the rest youngsters of different
ages. The whole were of good families, and liberally
supported by their friends. I was called upon
to subscribe my monthly quota towards the mess,
which was received by one of the senior members,
acting as caterer; and a plentiful sea-stock of all
necessary comforts was daily accumulating, preparatory
to our approaching cruise in the North-sea,
to which station the Astræa belonged.</p>

<p>About a week after my joining the ship, the captain
came on board, received me very politely, and
gave me the best advice as to my future conduct.
He was an old officer who had been at sea from
his youth, possessed an excellent heart, and a most
conciliating address, blended with the bluntness and
unaffected good humour peculiar to seamen. He
was advanced in years at the time I served under
him; and I perceive by a late <i>Navy List</i> that his
long and meritorious services have been rewarded
with the post of Governor of the Naval Asylum, an
institution which does honour to the country and
the government that established it.</p>

</div>

<p>In a few days, the frigate being completely equipped,
was cast off from alongside the Carolina, and
all hands being on board, we dropped down to the
Nore, from whence we sailed for Yarmouth Roads,
where the admiral of the North Sea fleet was then
lying; soon after which we put to sea, on a cruise
off the coast of Holland. I immediately applied
myself assiduously to the study of navigation, in
which I was so successful, that I was in a few weeks
capable of keeping a dead reckoning. It was required
of the midshipmen to deliver in daily at noon,
an account of the ship’s course, distance, <i>&amp;c.</i>, performed
in the last 24 hours. These different calculations,
deduced from the remarks on the log-board,
were presented to the captain, who, on a comparison<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of the whole, formed his opinion of the several operators’
ingenuity, and praised or censured accordingly.
I had the satisfaction to find that my performances
were generally approved of, and gained
me much applause from their correctness. This
success was probably owing to the advantages I
possessed over most of my companions, in point of
education, improved by extensive practice in figures,
and to a closeness of application arising from my experience
in the world, of which they (whose acquirements
were merely scholastic) were incapable. I
was remarked also for the neatness and perspicuity
with which I kept my log-book and journal, which
I never suffered, like many others, to be in arrears.
I was not quite so happy in my efforts to become a
good practical sailor. I learnt indeed, with great facility,
the names and uses of every rope in the ship,
and could apply to them without hesitation on all
occasions, and I had a correct idea of the manœuvres
necessary in tacking, wearing, reefing, <i>&amp;c.</i>, as far
as theory extended; but unhappily my constitution
being naturally delicate, and my nerves uncommonly
weak, I found myself much embarrassed, when duty
or inclination prompted me to go aloft, on which
occasions I was subject to a giddiness in my head,
which rendered my situation extremely perilous, and
though I endeavoured by perseverance to overcome
this weakness, I could never totally banish the timidity
with which I was affected. On this account, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
I continued indefatigable in every other point of my
duty, I desisted, particularly in blowing weather, from
ascending “the high and giddy mast;” and I am firmly
persuaded that it is only by going to sea at a very
tender age, that youth in general are rendered callous
to danger, and insensible of those fears, to
which I was at all times more or less subject. It
is also probable that the various excesses in which I
had indulged since I first quitted my friends, had
contributed to impair a constitution naturally fragile,
and to relax still more the nervous system.
Our first cruise produced no incident worth notice.
We maintained our station, when the weather would
permit, off the Texel, and were frequently so near
the land, that we could distinguish and count the
Dutch fleet, lying at anchor in that harbour, from
our mast-head: but Mynheer was not disposed to
put to sea, of which event we were ordered to convey
immediate intelligence to the admiral. The
winter was now approaching, and there was every
appearance of its proving unusually inclement.
During this cruise, we lay-to for twenty-one successive
days, in a tremendous gale from the N. E.,
with only a storm jib, and fly-sail set; and although
we were in no immediate danger, having good sea-room,
and a tight ship, I found my ardour for a sea-faring
life considerably abated. I was obliged to
turn out of a warm bed at 12 or 4 o’clock in each
night, to take my watch, the hardship of which duty<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
was a severe penance upon me. The excessive
cold, added to loss of rest, produced a drowsiness
which rendered me incapable of resisting the inclination
I felt to sleep, whenever I could retire to a
private spot unobserved; which was generally in the
long-boat, under a gun carriage, or some such hiding
place. I was, however, frequently discovered in my
retreat, by accident, or by the mischievous information
of some watch-mate, whose hardy frame was proof
against fatigue. On those occasions the lieutenant
of the watch would order the rest of the midshipmen
to throw a horse-bucket of salt-water over me, which
did not fail to awaken me quickly: but on starting
up, shivering and amazed, I could never ascertain the
perpetrators of this ablution, who having disappeared,
would come up to me, very gravely condoling
on my misfortune, which they stated to proceed
from a grampus having blown over me from
alongside. This piece of sea wit, which I soon
understood, produced a general laugh at my expense;
how ever I was as ready at other times to
practise the same exploit upon some other unlucky
sleeper; and my chief consolation was, that the
farce always ended with the sufferer being ordered
to take off his wet clothes, and turn in to his hammock,
which sometimes saved two or three hours
on deck. At other times, sleeping on our watch, or
other instances of remissness in duty, were not so
slightly passed over; we were sometimes sentenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
to sit on the main-top-mast head, for two, four, and
sometimes eight hours; at other times to sit on the
weather cat-head, exposed to a cutting wind; and
other similar punishments, depending on the humour
or severity of the officer of the watch. In addition
to the hardships and fatigues of duty, I began to
find my situation in the mess grow daily more irksome.
I soon perceived that a midshipman’s birth
(or mess-room) is an epitome of the world at large,
the weaker party goes to the wall, and is subject to
many insults and impositions from those who are
his superiors in seniority, strength, or interest.
There were also frequent instances of intrigue and
treachery; and as among so many persons there
must be various dispositions, there were not wanting
envious and malicious minds, whose delight was
in fomenting mischief and detraction. Being naturally
of a peaceable turn, hating nothing so much
as a life of dissension, and abhorring tyranny of
every description, I now wished myself emancipated
from this state of bondage, as to me it seemed; and
I discovered, when too late, that “all is not gold
that glitters,” and that the situation of a midshipman
(which I had once considered the <i>summum
bonum</i> of honour and happiness) was not, any more
than others, wholly free from care and inquietude.
However I continued to weather the gale, as well
as I could; and conscious of the rectitude of my intentions,
suffered patiently those little mortifications
I had not power to avert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>After a cruise of two months, we returned to
port, when I had the pleasure of hearing from my
respected friends in S⸺shire. Our stay in Yarmouth
roads was short; we put to sea again in company
with several smaller vessels, of which our captain
was commodore. A violent storm, however,
soon dispersed our little squadron, and we at length
with much difficulty gained the river Humber, from
whence we returned to Yarmouth. During this winter
we were continually at sea, except for very short
intervals; and the oldest seaman in the ship declared
they had never known a more tempestuous season.
Several fine frigates, sloops, brigs, <i>&amp;c.</i>, were lost in
the North Sea, and on the northern coasts of England.
My hardships, of course, rather increased
than diminished, and I heartily repented the step I
had taken; not that I disliked the service, or the
mode of living on ship-board; but I found myself
unequal to the duty of watching, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and was
also uncomfortably situated with respect to my
messmates, whose manners and ideas of enjoyment
did not coincide with mine. The notion of finding
pleasure in books was ridiculed by them; and I
was sometimes told that I ought to have been a
parson; but it was agreed on all sides, that I was
better adapted for a clerk than a sailor. These
hints and suggestions were not thrown away upon
me; I felt the force of their justice, and longed for
an opportunity of ameliorating my situation which
at length, to my great joy, unexpectedly occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The captain’s clerk I have before mentioned was,
by the interest of Captain Dacres, promoted to
the rank of purser; and as soon as this was known,
my brother Mids unanimously advised me, in the
sea phrase, to “bear up” for a scribe; meaning to
quit my present station, and petition the captain to
receive me as his clerk. I took this advice, and was
happy enough to succeed. As I had spent much
of my time with my predecessor, and took pleasure
in observing his various public accompts, in the execution
of which I had often assisted him, I required
but little instruction to enable me to undertake
this office.</p>

<p>I must not omit to notice here, a laughable incident,
consequent on my dereliction. The midshipmen
in general, on the day of my appointment, surrounded
me in our cabin, and with great ceremony,
proceeded to cut off the <i>weekly accompts</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> from the
coat I had on; proclaiming, at the same time, that I
had now assumed a different character, and had no
further right to the honourable uniform of a Mid.
I was obliged, therefore, to have this appendage taken
from every coat and jacket I possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Behold me now once more in my own sphere!
Though I had relinquished the hope of ever becoming
an admiral, yet here was another field for
promotion opened for me. After a service of two
years, I might obtain a purser’s warrant, which,
though a less honourable station than the former, is
perhaps more lucrative, and certainly less exposed
to danger.</p>

<p>I had now a commodious cabin to myself, in
which I was free from interruption, only frequenting
the mess cabin at meal times, or when I was inclined
for company. I slept peaceably in my cot,
while my former companions were exposed to the
wind and weather upon deck. As to the duties of
my office, they were merely a source of pleasing
amusement to me: I soon became expert in their
performance; and my attention gained me the
esteem of both captain and purser.</p>

<p>It is needless to trouble the reader with a journal
of the ship’s proceedings, during the remainder of
the time I continued in her; it may suffice to state
briefly, that we took many cruises in the North Sea,
in the course of which we visited the Orkney Isles,
Leith Roads, the River Humber, Osely Bay, Robin
Hood’s Bay, Harwich Harbour, and other anchorages
on the coasts of England and Scotland, to
which we were driven by stress of weather, or other
causes. In one of our cruises, we captured a beautiful
French lugger privateer, of fourteen guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
fifty-eight men, belonging to Dunkirk, after a chase
of three hours, in a gale of wind, in which we went at
the rate of thirteen and a half knots per hour, under
a fore-sail and close reefed main top-sail only.
During the ensuing summer, being appointed to
convoy above three hundred sail of merchantmen to
the Baltic Sea, we lay for several weeks at Elsineur,
in Denmark; at which place I went on shore, and
had some pleasant rambles into the adjacent country,
visiting Copenhagen which is twenty miles distant.
I also viewed the interior of that ancient castle,
celebrated by Shakspeare in the tragedy of
<i>Hamlet</i>, and many other local curiosities.</p>

<p>The following spring, the Astræa was ordered up
the river Thames, for the purpose of receiving on
board two hundred thousand pounds in specie,
which she was to convey to Cuxhaven, for the use
of the Hamburgh merchants. We accordingly
came to an anchor at Greenhithe, sixteen miles from
London; and while the ship was undergoing some
little repairs, I obtained leave of absence for three
days, of which I availed myself to visit London,
with the view of having a short cruise in that region
of pleasure. As I had lately received both pay and
prize-money, and had also been economical of what
my relations had occasionally remitted me, I was
well provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>On the first night of my arrival in town, I went,
of course, to the play, where I was struck with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
appearance of a very interesting young Cyprian,
whom I immediately accosted, and after the performance,
attended to her apartments in Bury-Street,
St. James’s. Here every thing was upon
the most elegant scale, and I was so well pleased
with my quarters as well as with the lady, that I did
not stir tack or sheet (except on short excursions of
pleasure in which she accompanied me) until the
expiration of my liberty, and then it was with much
reluctance, I could tear myself from this fascinating
fair one. I was the more charmed with her, as she
exhibited a generosity of mind, seldom met with in
females of her description: and though she might
have extracted from me my last shilling, yet she was
so far from being mercenary, that my expenses,
considering the enjoyments I had experienced, were
comparatively trifling. I returned, then, to my ship
in due time, but still the thoughts of the lovely Miss
K⸺e incessantly recurred, and prevented my
enjoying a moment’s peace. My anxiety was increased
by receiving a most affectionate letter from
her, within three days, according to a promise she
had given me at parting, in which she earnestly
requested my leave to visit me on board prior to
our sailing. To this I would not, however, consent,
but gave a sort of conditional promise, almost
indeed amounting to a positive one, that I would see
her again in town.</p>

<p>About a week after my return from London, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
resolved to pay a second visit to my inamorata; but
as we were now ready for sea, and expected the
specie on board every hour, it was in vain to solicit
leave. I therefore determined to go ashore early
as if to spend the day, which the whole of the petty
officers were allowed to do in turn. My intention
was to go post to London, and after a day and a
night’s pleasure, to return on board early the next
morning, as I could easily frame some excuse for
staying ashore all night.</p>

<p>From some secret presentiment, however, which
I conceived at the moment I was about to step in
the jolly-boat, I hurried down to my chest, and hastily
filling a clothes-bag with linen, gave it to one
of the boys, as if to take to the washerwoman, and
immediately quitted His Majesty’s ship Astræa (as
the event proved) never more to return. I procured
a man to carry my bag to Dartford, a post town three
miles from Greenhithe, and fifteen from London;
from whence I took a chaise, and in less than two
hours found myself in the arms of my fair enslaver.
In order to give the reader leisure to reflect on the
blindness of mankind to their own welfare, and to
revile me in particular, as I deserve, for this mad
and unjustifiable conduct, I shall put an end to this
Chapter.</p>

<p>The reader will here observe that I had left
behind me, on my desertion, a valuable chest of
clothes, books, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>, the purchase of which, but
sixteen months before, had cost my affectionate
friends a large sum; and I had now, by this rash
act, defeated their fondest hopes, and brought disgrace
as well on them as on the worthy officer who
procured me the appointment. It is impossible,
however, for my reader to condemn my folly, or
rather wickedness, in stronger terms than my own
conscience has ever since done. Surely there must,
let moralists argue as they will, be something like
a fatality which governs the fortunes of some, if not
all, men; and which impels them headlong to their
ruin, against the voice of reason and of conscience,
and the dictates of common sense. But the retrospect
affects me too much: I must not aggravate
my present sufferings by dwelling longer on what
will not bear reflection. All I can now do is to repent
of all my errors; and I trust that Divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Power will accept my repentance who best knows
its sincerity.</p>

<p>Before I resume the thread of my narrative, I
will just venture to give the reader a few lines, descriptive
of a midshipman’s life, which will require,
I trust, no apology, when I state that they were the
production of some of the junior members of our mess,
and composed in the space of a very few hours.—Of
the correctness of the picture therein drawn, I
can truly say, <i>probatum est</i>.</p>

<p>After the first transports of our meeting had subsided,
it was mutually agreed that I should reside
altogether with Miss K⸺e, who, being ignorant
of my real circumstances, imagined I was
capable of maintaining her and myself, if not in the
most splendid, at least in a comfortable manner.
I should have stated, however, that the pleasure I
felt at being once more free from control, and on
my near approach to my favourite spot, London,
added to the passion I had conceived for this young
lady, had completely banished every idea of returning
to my ship, long before I was set down at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the obelisk in St. George’s Fields, where I had exchanged
my chaise for a hackney coach, to prevent
my being traced.</p>

<p>The following morning I examined into the state
of my personal effects; which I found to consist of
a dozen fine shirts, about the same number of neck-cloths,
hose, and waistcoats, a few odd articles of
other apparel, and twenty-one pounds in money,
together with an old family gold watch, and the
suit of blue I had on my back.</p>

<p>My fair acquaintance evinced some concern at
the rash step I had taken; which, imputing wholly
to my affection for herself, drew from her professions
of gratitude and constancy, which I believe
(from her youth and ingenuous mind) to have been
sincere. I determined now to domesticate myself
with this charming woman for a few weeks; as well
to make up for the privations I had suffered for the
last sixteen months, by enjoying every comfort money
could procure, as to preclude any risk of being apprehended
for desertion before the ship’s departure.</p>

<p>During this retirement, which I might justly call
a honeymoon, from the happiness I experienced,
I obtained from Miss K⸺e some account of
herself, and the misfortunes which had reduced her
to the disgraceful situation in which I found her.
The following are the particulars:—</p>

<p>She was the second daughter of a respectable
tradesman in the city, who had placed her, with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
elder sister, at a boarding school in Queen-square,
where she had become perfectly accomplished.
About a year before our acquaintance began, she
had been accidentally seen walking in the garden
of the square, to which the young ladies had access,
by an officer of dragoons, who, being struck with
her beauty, had employed every art of bribery and
intrigue, first to open a correspondence by letter,
and afterwards to obtain a personal interview, of
which opportunity he made such good use that he
succeeded in seducing this amiable child, then just
fifteen years of age, to elope from her school, to
sacrifice to him, honour, fortune, and parental affection,
and entail on herself ruin, remorse, and endless
shame!</p>

<p>This gallant hero treated her with the fondest attention,
and spared no expense to gratify her every
wish, and, by a continual round of splendid dissipation,
to banish any reflections which might otherwise
obtrude themselves; and in this (owing to her
youth and the natural levity of her sex,) he so far
succeeded that she felt not, for the first six months,
those compunctions which, sooner or later, must
attend conscious guilt. At the end of that time,
however, her protector, being ordered abroad with
his regiment, left her with a slender provision in
possession; but for which he made up with most
liberal promises of future bounty. It is probable
he had by this time gratified a passion which was at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
first but of a sensual nature; and I am led to think
his going abroad was only a fiction, the better to
cover his base design of deserting her: be this as it
might, she had never since heard from him; and, as
her little money was soon exhausted, she found herself
alone and friendless, and now first began to reflect
on the consequences of her imprudence. She
had, on quitting the school, assumed the name of
K⸺e, which I have recorded her by, in order
to avoid the inquiries of her family; to whom shame
and (perhaps false) delicacy, now deterred her from
a thought of returning. In the late scenes of her
guilty prosperity she had formed an acquaintance
with several kept women who were living, like herself,
in elegant infamy. She now had recourse to
some of these friends for temporary assistance; but
alas! they soon convinced her how little is to be
expected from such friendship, when adversity renders
it most essential. In a fatal moment she took
the usual course of persons similarly situated; she
procured a suitable lodging where her misfortunes
were not known, and frequented the theatres and
other public places; at which (being a new face
on the town), she was successful above all her competitors
in attracting the notice of the male sex.
The pecuniary emoluments she thence derived had
enabled her to live elegantly; and her person and
carriage were so much above the common class of
Cyprians that she was still, at the time I first saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
her, an object of general admiration. Fortunately
also her health was yet untainted, so that, could I
have found means for our mutual support, this connexion
promised to be a source of happiness to us
both. She felt happy at the opportunity of quitting
a course of life which had always disgusted her;
and little regret for the past (being ignorant of the
true state of my finances) save when a melancholy
thought of her disconsolate family caused a temporary
effusion of grief.</p>

<p>The first month or honeymoon of our connexion
being expired, and the Astræa long departed from
the river, I began to revolve in my mind the means
of future subsistence. As I had spared no expense
to render our retirement pleasing, and had purchased
for myself a suit of plain clothes, I now
found myself reduced to my last guinea, and I knew
that unless I hit upon some mode of speedily recruiting,
I must have recourse to the pawnbroker for
another. These unpleasing reflections gave me
much uneasiness; but I carefully concealed it from
my partner, and preserved the same air of cheerfulness
as before. At length came “th’ inevitable
hour.” Money was wanting for household purposes,
and I was obliged to raise a few pounds, by
depositing my watch in the usual place of security.
I accounted for the absence of this article by a pretence
that it wanted repair. This small supply
lasted but a fortnight, as we retrenched nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
our mode of living; and I had lately accompanied
my dear Sarah to the theatres, and other places of
diversion, for which amusement she had as violent
a passion as myself. But I have now to relate an
event, which no less afflicted than surprised me,
and of which I had not the most distant apprehension.</p>

<p>One night, towards the close of the last mentioned
period, we had returned late from the opera,
and, being in high spirits though low in pocket, I
proposed to send for a small collation from the
neighbouring tavern, and to indulge in a little extra
festivity: this was approved of by my charmer, who
indeed had no will but mine; and, our little maid
having procured the necessary requisites, we enjoyed
a most comfortable supper; after which we
circulated the cheering glass, the wine receiving an
additional zest from the wit and enlivening conversation
of my fair companion. But mark the uncertainty
of human happiness!</p>

<p>About two o’clock, as we were on the point of
retiring to rest, we were surprised by a sudden and
loud knock at the street door, which being unusual
at so late an hour, caused a momentary alarm to us
both. Before we had time to form any idea of the
cause, the door of our apartment was burst rudely
open, and three persons entered, at the sight of
whom, my unfortunate girl fainted in my arms, on
the sofa whereon we sat. One of the three persons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
a respectable looking elderly gentleman, from his
tender anxiety, but mixed with some degree of severity,
I soon conjectured to be her unhappy father;
in which I was not mistaken. The other two immediately
called the landlady of the house, by whose
assistance they recovered the poor girl from her
swoon; which having accomplished, they instantly
hurried her down stairs, the old gentleman darting
an angry look at me, and left me so stupified with
grief and surprise, that I had not power to follow,
or notice their proceedings. I soon afterwards
heard a coach drive from the door, on which the
latter was immediately shut, and the landlady coming
up, informed me of what she had gathered during
a short conversation from the parties. It appeared
that the young lady had been seen with me
the preceding night at the opera-house, by a friend of
her family, who knowing of her elopement, had officiously
followed us home, and then immediately
given information to her father, who applying instantly
to Sir William Ford, the Bow-Street magistrate,
that gentleman had detached Messrs. Townshend
and Carpmeal (two of his principal officers) to
assist him in the recovery of his lost child. This
they had effected as I have described; the anxiety
of her parent not suffering him to defer the business
even till the ensuing day. The woman added that
on learning from her, the life his daughter had led
for some months prior to her acquaintance with me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and that I was not her original seducer, he had declined
the idea of apprehending me, which the officers
were otherwise empowered to do.</p>

<p>This melancholy event was a grievous affliction to
me, who had relinquished an honourable situation,
purely on her account; and was now not only deprived
of a beloved object, but reduced to a state
of utter poverty. Notwithstanding every inquiry I
could institute, I could never obtain any further information
as to the fate of Miss K⸺e, than
what I extracted by a bribe from one of the officers,
who assured me that it was her father’s intention to
send her to a remote part of the kingdom, where she
had a female relation who had undertaken the care of
her: but this man declared that the name of her parents
was known only to the magistrate, which was
perhaps true: and the dear girl had never even disclosed
her real name to myself, but had almost promised
so to do on a little longer acquaintance.</p>

<p>I now quitted this lodging, the wearing apparel
of my late companion being claimed by the landlady
for some arrears of rent, as the father had refused
to take any thing from the house, and never approached
it more. I engaged a small apartment for
myself in a more centrical situation; and, to supply
my immediate wants, deposited one article after another
at the pawnbroker’s, till I had no longer any
thing left to deposit.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, before my appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
became too shabby, to find some means of support.
As to my friends, I had given up every idea of returning
to them, nor did I, for some months after this,
acquaint them of the rash step I had taken: and
when I afterwards did so, I amused my poor grandfather
with a fictitious account of my having returned
to the law, and assured him that I was doing
well; for as I have before hinted, I was so sensible
of the inconvenience which that worthy man must
unavoidably suffer in his old age, from his too great
liberality to me, that I determined to submit to any
hardships rather than be a further incumbrance
upon him.</p>

<p>I had, during my former residence in London,
taken great delight in billiards, and, by a frequent
attendance at public tables, had become a tolerably
good player. I had renewed my acquaintance with
this game, since my last arrival in town; and, urged
by necessity, I now deemed it possible to pick up
a little money at one of these <i>boards of green cloth</i>.
For this purpose I attended daily at the rooms in
Bow-Street, Covent Garden, where, by a few days
play with the marker, I gained a knowledge of the
tables; and, as nothing contributes like practice to
improve one at this scientific game, I was soon enabled
to engage with such gentlemen as accidentally
dropped in for an hour’s amusement, which I
obligingly afforded them at the expense of a few
shillings.</p>

<p>These opportunities, however, only occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the early part of the day; for in the evenings, the
tables, as well as the spoil, were engrossed by a combination
of five or six sharpers, who regularly attended
for the same purpose as myself; but their
operations were upon a more extensive scale: by
forming sham matches among themselves, engaging
by-standers to bet on either side, and then playing
booty, and by various other expedients, they frequently
obtained large sums, and were enabled to
appear genteelly about town. These gentry soon
viewed me with a jealous eye; regarding me, I suppose,
as an interloper, who encroached upon their
rights of plunder. I therefore found it would be
necessary to have an understanding with their party,
by which means I should reap a much better harvest
than I could do by a mere course of fair play,
in which I was sometimes unavoidably beat. I at
length effected my object, by means of an elderly
man, whose good-natured countenance encouraged
me to introduce a conversation on the subject.
This person, who was a veteran in the arts of play,
and of some consequence in the gang, seemed flattered
by the respectful manner in which I addressed
him, and, complimenting me on the talents I possessed,
assured me I should receive from himself
every advice requisite to render me useful; and that
I might depend on the most equitable treatment in
the division of any money I might be accessary to
obtaining.</p>

<p>I was the same evening formally accepted as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
member of this sharping fraternity; and after a libation
at the Piazza coffee-house, they repaired to
the scene of action, where I soon afterwards dropped
in, as if by accident; and, having played a few
games with the marker, in which I betrayed great
want of skill, I was at length challenged by one of
our party, who had been seen at other times to play
well. Of course, bets in plenty were offered
against me; and in the middle of the game, pretending
to be irritated at the general discouragement
of the by-standers, I affected to grow warm,
and took odds of several gentlemen, that I won the
game (which was now six to four against me); my
antagonist also backed himself by laying the same
odds with some of our confederates, after which, no
more bets being offered, he relaxed a little in his
play. I improved in proportion, and having, for
form’s sake, suffered the game to arrive at twenty
all, the flats (or strangers) began to look foolish, and
endeavoured to hedge off, as the phrase is, but without
effect. I therefore made a successful hazard, and
decided the game, to the great chagrin of those who
had so warmly opposed me. The person who
played with me, declared I had won by mere luck,
and random play, and, throwing down his bets with
a passionate air, swore he would play me the following
day for a larger sum, and give me five points.
This finesse prevented any suspicion in the minds
of the losers, whom it was our interest to keep ignorant
of the combination existing. The room soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
after getting thin, we departed one at a time, and
meeting at the usual place, apportioned the division
of the evening’s profit, which amounted to about
thirty pounds.</p>

<p>I continued to associate with this knot of gamblers
for several weeks; but I soon found that our
success was very uncertain, depending upon the
number of strangers who happened to visit the
rooms; as those who had once been duped by us,
were always cautious in future, and would neither
play nor bet with us. It was only, therefore,
from gentlemen who were not in the habit of frequenting
this house, that we had a chance of gaining
any thing worth notice: so that upon the whole,
what I acquired was barely sufficient to keep me
above want. The summer too, having now commenced,
at which season there is but little company
at the billiard rooms, the confederates to whom I
had attached myself, left town upon a tour to the
different races, some with an E O table, others
trusting to their general abilities at hazard playing,
cocking, <i>&amp;c.</i> As I had neither found the pleasure
or profit which I derived from a connexion with
them to afford that satisfaction I expected, I was
not concerned at a separation from them. I
therefore rubbed on as well as I could by myself,
spending my leisure time much in my usual manner,
but always taking care to preserve a genteel appearance,
on which I knew every success depended.</p>

<p>As I was one morning reading the papers at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
coffee-house where I commonly breakfasted, I met
with an advertisement for a clerk to an attorney in
the country. As this was a situation I had never
held, and the season of the year was favourable to
an excursion, I determined to offer my services, promising
myself, at least, to derive some benefit to my
health, and amusement from changing the scene;
but I had always a partiality for London, and could
never wholly reconcile myself to a country life, since
I first tasted of the various pleasures with which
the metropolis abounds.</p>

<p>I immediately applied to the advertising parties,
Messrs. Dalton and Edwards, in King’s Bench
Walk, Temple, and was introduced to the latter
gentleman, who informed me it was a Mr. Dalton
of Bury St. Edmunds, who wanted a clerk capable
of conducting his business. As I had acquired a
greater share of experience, and a better insight of
the different branches of the profession, than many
others would do in a much longer course of service, I
hesitated not to undertake the duties required; and as
expedition was necessary, Mr. Edwards, after some few
inquiries, engaged me immediately at a weekly salary
of one pound, which in so cheap a part of the country,
he observed, was equal to twice the sum in
London. He desired me if possible, to set out
that very day, and writing a short letter of introduction
to Mr. Dalton, gave it me, together with a
small sum to bear my expenses to Bury. I then<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
took my leave, and having gained the street, I was
curious to know in what terms my credentials ran.
The wafer being still wet, I opened the letter, in which
Mr. Edwards had briefly stated the agreement he
had made with me, and concluded in these words:
“I have every reason to believe him an expert clerk,
and do not doubt but he will prove an acquisition.”
How far this good gentleman’s prediction was verified,
the next Chapter will disclose. I lost no time
in preparing for my journey, and having but few
clothes to pack up, I took my departure from the
Blue Boar in Bishopsgate-street, at seven o’clock,
P. M., and the next morning arrived at St. Edmundsbury.</p>

</div>

<p>I found Mr. Dalton to be a gentleman of high
respectability in his profession, and of the most
prepossessing manners. He gave me a very kind
and polite reception, and after some conversation,
conducted me himself to the best inn in the town,
where he ordered that I should be entertained at
his expense, until I could provide myself a convenient
residence. Mr. Dalton had a very handsome
house, and kept several servants, but, being a bachelor
and a good deal from home, it was not convenient
for me to reside with him. The day after my arrival,
he, therefore, advised me to make inquiry for
board and lodging in some regular and decent family,
and to consult him on the eligibility before I made
any engagement. I accordingly began my inquiries,
and at length found accommodation in the family
of a tradesman of whom Mr. Dalton approved.
Here I was to be lodged and boarded very comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
at nine shillings per week! This charge,
to me, who had been accustomed to the expenses
of London, appeared moderate in the extreme:
however, being willing to make the best bargain I
could, I informed the good woman, that as I should
receive my salary quarterly from Mr. Dalton, I
could only undertake to pay her at the like period,
to which proposal she therefore readily consented.
My motive in this proceeding was, that in case I
quitted Bury before the end of the first quarter,
I might decamp without coming to a settlement,
and by this means have my weekly pay of twenty
shillings entire for other purposes.</p>

<p>Having removed from the inn to my new abode, I
was instructed by Mr. Dalton in the nature of my
employment, which was chiefly to copy or engross
deeds in conveyancing, and other similar documents,
peculiar to country practitioners. In a few days I
had a correct idea of what was necessary to be done,
and Mr. Dalton perceiving I required no instruction
from him, gave me sole charge of the office,
which was detached from his house, and left it to my
discretion as to the hours or duration of my attendance.
This liberty I did not abuse, but kept
every thing in such exact order that I had soon the
pleasure of giving him entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalton kept a gig, and two blood-horses: as
he had a good deal of public business, relating to
county matters, and was one of the commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
for the redemption of the land-tax, which sometimes
obliged him to attend meetings at the several
market-towns round about Bury, he often took me
with him in his gig, attended by his servant on
horseback. On these occasions there were usually
public dinners at the principal inns, provided at the
expense of the county, or the persons interested.
The fare was always sumptuous, and there was no
stint of the best wines. At other times I was detached
on horseback, accompanied by the servant
as a guide, to transact business with different clients,
in various parts of the county. I was not limited
in my expenses, and the account I presented on my
return, was freely liquidated by Mr. Dalton.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, this was one of the most agreeable
employments I ever engaged in, and had I
prudently retained it for a few years, there is no
doubt but I should have met with the most liberal
encouragement from my employer. But my natural
inconstancy still prevailed; and I had been but a
few weeks at Bury, before I grew tired of the
country, and thought of nothing but returning to
London, with such spoil as I could obtain from
the credulity of the tradesmen in the town. With
this view, I bespoke clothes, boots, linen, and
other articles at various shops, informing the parties
that I should expect credit till the expiration of my
quarter, to which, on account of the respectable
gentleman I served, they readily consented. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
soon as any of these goods were brought home, I
immediately packed them up in small portable
parcels, which I sent up to London by the coach,
consigned to a pawnbroker with whom I was
on intimate terms; desiring him to receive and
keep them safe, until he saw me. I also coached
off in the same clandestine manner, such of my own
apparel, <i>&amp;c.</i>, as I had in my trunk, in which, to prevent
discovery, I deposited stones or bricks to preserve
its gravity. By these means I had nothing to
impede my sudden departure, when rendered necessary
by the arrival of the expected quarter-day.</p>

<p>I must here observe, to meet any surprise the
reader might feel on the subject, that as I had never
at this time been connected with downright thieves,
so I had never yet committed an actual theft, save
the embezzlement of money at Liverpool; (which
indeed the law has lately made a felonious taking;)
though I therefore scrupled not at practising a
fraud, I was not yet sufficiently depraved to commit
a robbery. This will account for my not
robbing the premises of Mr. Dalton, which at a
subsequent period of my life, would have been my
primary object, as I had access to every part of the
house, and have frequently viewed with longing eyes,
the servant cleaning a handsome service of plate in
the pantry.</p>

<p>I had now been about two months at Bury, and
had no intention of absconding till the expiration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the third; when an accidental event induced me to
hasten my departure. One afternoon Mr. Dalton
had written several letters in the office, and the footman
being elsewhere engaged, he requested me to
drop them in the post-office, in my way home. I accordingly
brought them out in my hand, and happening
inadvertently to cast my eye on the superscriptions,
I perceived that one was addressed to
Mr. Lyne, tailor, Cecil-street, Strand, London.
Being curious to know what correspondence Mr.
Dalton could have with a tailor, I opened this letter,
and found the contents to the following effect:
“Mr. Lyne,—By the waggon which goes from hence
on Monday next, and arrives at the Blue Boar in
Bishopsgate-street on Wednesday night, I shall
send you a portmanteau corded and sealed, but not
locked, containing two coats, sixteen waistcoats,
fourteen pair of breeches, and a suit of uniform
of the city Light Horse<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Most of these articles
are nearly as good as new, but as they have now
become unfashionable, I desire you will dispose
of them to the best advantage, on my account,
and send me down by the same conveyance, two
suits made in the present taste,” <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>It immediately struck me, that if I took measures
accordingly, I might arrive in town time enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
intercept and obtain this trunk from the inn; for
which purpose I put this letter in my pocket, and
the others in the post-office. The next day, happening
to go into Mr. Dalton’s kitchen, I there saw
the portmanteau corded up, and directed; and on
questioning the servant in a careless manner about
it, he informed me that he was going to carry it to
the ⸺ inn, the following evening, in readiness
for the departure of the waggon. The same afternoon
it happened, (which was a most fortunate circumstance
for me,) that Mr. Dalton again begged of
me to put some letters in the post-office, which he had
not done above twice or thrice since I came into his
service. Looking at these letters, I saw to my
surprise, another addressed to Mr. Lyne as before,
which, eagerly opening, I found was to mention
something Mr. Dalton said he had forgot in his letter
of the preceding day. I immediately destroyed this
second letter, which (had it come to hand) might
have frustrated my design.</p>

<p>I now prepared matters for eloping, and sent off
the remainder of my effects by the coach as before:
but my good fortune produced another windfall
of which I had no expectation. The day before
my intended departure, I was walking in the
market-place with a young man, who was clerk to
another attorney in the town, and the conversation
turning upon watches, my companion observed that
if I wished to purchase one, he would introduce me<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to a maker of his acquaintance, who would use me
well on his account. I took him at his word, and
begged he would immediately do so. We were
then within a few doors of the shop, into which we
entered; and I perceived over the window in large
characters, “Lumley and <i>Gudgeon</i>, Watchmakers.”
I laughed inwardly at the singularity of the latter
name, which I considered ominous of my success
in the imposition I meant to put upon him. After
a short preliminary conversation, my acquaintance
having business to do, took his leave, and Mr.
Gudgeon himself proceeded to shew me several
watches. I informed him that I wished to have a
good one, but my circumstances would not allow
me to go to a high price. Mr. Gudgeon assured
me it was better to have a good one at once, and
recommended me a very handsome gilt watch,
capped and jewelled, and his own make, which he
said he could warrant to perform well, and for
which he asked me eight guineas. I replied that
as my weekly salary from Mr. Dalton was but one
pound, I could not afford to give so much, and
began to examine others of a cheaper kind, but still
letting him see that I had a strong inclination for
the one he had recommended. This induced him
to repeat his praises of the latter, and to press me
with greater energy, to fix upon it. I at length
(with a shew of much reluctance) suffered myself
to be persuaded; but I begged leave to observe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
that as I was influenced in every thing by the advice
of my good master, Mr. Dalton, I would not
venture to make so expensive a purchase without
his approbation; that if he would therefore intrust
me with the watch, I would consult Mr. Dalton
and give him (Mr. Gudgeon,) a decisive answer
the next morning: this he declared himself willing
to do, on which I took both the watch and my
leave together, and returned home.</p>

<p>The next morning I attended the office as usual,
but of course took no notice to Mr. Dalton of the
affair in hand. During the space of time I allotted
myself for dinner, I again called on Mr. Gudgeon,
and told him that I should keep the watch, provided
he would receive the payment by instalments, as
I could not afford to pay the whole price at once.
I therefore proposed to give him the ensuing Saturday,
one or two guineas, as I should find most convenient,
and to pay him half-a-guinea a week afterwards, until
the whole was liquidated. To this he readily
agreed, and having fitted a key to the watch, he
begged leave to shew me some chains and seals.
Of the former he had none but gilt ones: I selected
one of the neatest, and a handsome gold seal. I
then desired to have a bill of parcels of the whole,
observing that whenever I paid a sum upon account,
Mr. Gudgeon could make a memorandum of it at
the bottom by way of receipt. Having obtained
this, I departed, promising to be punctual in paying<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
my first instalment on the day appointed. This took
place on Tuesday, the portmanteau being now on
its way to London; and the same evening I quitted
my lodgings privately, leaving nothing behind but a
trunk, containing brickbats and stones, and walked
by moonlight to a village four miles distant, through
which the stage-coach was to pass the next morning
at 7 o’clock. I procured some supper at a decent
public-house, and retired to rest, desiring to be
called in time for the coach. At the expected hour
the stage made its appearance, in which I seated
myself, and about eight the same evening, arrived
at the Blue Boar, just two hours after the waggon,
which I perceived standing in the yard.</p>

<p>As soon as I descended from the coach, I walked
into the coach-office, and inquired of the book-keeper,
if the Bury waggon was arrived; he replying
that it was, I told him that I expected a
trunk, and on my describing the direction, he looked
over the way-bill, and informed me there was such
an article, but the waggon would not be unladen
till the next morning, when I might obtain it by application.
I now retired to the Cross Keys in
Gracechurch-street, where I procured a bed; the
next morning, having breakfasted, I repaired to
the Blue Boar, where I had the pleasure of finding
the waggon unloaded; and boldly entering the office,
I inquired if I could have the trunk I had applied
for the night before. The clerk recollecting me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
searched for and found it immediately; and placing
it on the counter, demanded a trifling sum for
carriage. While I was joyfully opening my purse
to pay this demand, the book-keeper, seeming to
recollect himself, after a short apology, told me it
was not customary with him to deliver goods to a
stranger, without he was shewn a letter or other
authority to warrant such delivery, as so many
frauds had been practised upon inn keepers of late.
I affected to be a little displeased at his suspicion,
but acknowledging the justice of such precautions,
I assured him I had received a letter of advice from
Bury, but I doubted whether I had it about me, then
pulling out my pocket-book, hastily turned over a
number of papers, and pretending to be a little
concerned at my want of thought, informed the
clerk that I had left the letter at home, and must
therefore suffer him to send the trunk to Cecil-street,
although it would occasion an expense for
porterage which I intended to have saved; then
repeating my vexation, and carelessly arranging the
pocket-book, I luckily found the identical letter,
which I had (as I pretended) overlooked in my
haste. I now drew it forth in triumph, and obliquely
hinting how incapable I was of a fraudulent action
was opening the letter to shew him the contents;
but this cautious person took me aback a second
time, by observing that it was unnecessary to peruse
the letter, all that he required was to see the post-mark!<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
This was a difficulty of which I had not
the least idea, and was therefore unprepared to meet
it, and I have often since wondered that my confusion
did not betray me; but I had sufficient presence
of mind to answer with a smile, that I could
account for the absence of a post-mark, by informing
him that I received this letter enclosed in a
frank or envelope, which I had destroyed. This
satisfied him, and having read a few lines of the
letter, he delivered the trunk, which I brought away
from the inn, and having called a coach was driven
to Aldersgate-street, where I was set down at the
end of a narrow court or passage, leading to West-Smithfield;
through this court I proceeded on foot
to prevent my being traced, as no person could
follow me without my perceiving it. Being now
out of danger I took another coach in Smithfield,
and was carried to my friend the pawnbroker’s,
to whom I had consigned my effects from Bury;
but on my way, I purchased a handsome large
trunk, capable of containing the whole of my property,
including the contents of Mr. Dalton’s
portmanteau. The latter (on arriving at the pawnbroker’s)
I removed into my new trunk, and presented
my friend with the portmanteau; then
arranging also the contents of my various parcels,
and paying him for the carriage, <i>&amp;c.</i>, I left my trunk
in his care, until I had procured a lodging, which
was the next object I had in view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>I could not help applauding myself on the dexterity
with which I had accomplished this latter
adventure, as well as on the general success of my
expedition to Suffolk, on which I had been absent
from London exactly nine weeks. And when it is
considered that I was then but just turned of seventeen
years old, the reader must allow that I displayed
a genius and abilities which, had they been
devoted to more honourable purposes, would have
done me no small credit. But I am now writing
my “Confessions,” and shall therefore not attempt
to palliate my faults at the expense of my veracity.</p>

<p><i>Live gaily for a few weeks on the Spoils of my late
Excursion.—Again obliged to seek Employment.—Engage
with a Conveyancer in the Temple.—Apprehended
by my late Master.—Compromise the
Affair through the Friendship of a Relation.</i></p>

</div>

<p>I went immediately in quest of a lodging, and
found one to my mind in Roll’s Buildings, Fetter-Lane;
but as this was a respectable house, the landlady
required a reference to character, before she
would admit me as a lodger. I therefore gave her
the address of my friend and relation Mr. Presland,
whom I formerly served in Lincoln’s Inn. That
gentleman having satisfied her inquiries, I removed
my baggage from the pawnbroker’s, and took possession
of my new apartment.</p>

<p>The next day I examined the contents of Mr.
Dalton’s portmanteau, and found the whole of the
articles to be as he had described them, nearly new,
and all excellent in their kind. As I was not at
this time acquainted with a <i>Fence</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, to whom I could
dispose of this property, I had no other means of
turning them into money, than by pledging them at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
different pawnbrokers, which I did, one or two at a
time, for as much as I could get, taking out with me
every morning three or four articles in a bundle, so
that in a few days I had obtained money for the
whole.</p>

<p>I had now a good stock of clothes of my own, a
handsome watch in my pocket, and some pounds in
money, exclusive of the daily supplies I derived from
pledging Mr. Dalton’s apparel: I therefore began
to enjoy myself in the course of life in which I always
found the greatest satisfaction; breakfasting at
a coffee-house, dining at a tavern, and taking my tea
in the neighbourhood of the theatres, to one of which
I went almost every night. In the intervals of these
occupations, I amused myself in walking about
town, or viewing public exhibitions, but chiefly in
reading books of entertainment and instruction, to
the purchase of which, especially periodical works,
I every day devoted a small sum: so that upon the
whole, though I obtained my money by dishonourable
means, yet the manner in which I spent my
life was harmless to myself; nor did I ever, in the
most vicious part of my subsequent career, give myself
up to debauchery or intoxication, the idea of
which always disgusted me.</p>

<p>In this manner I lived happily for about five or six
weeks, when finding my ready money nearly exhausted,
I judged it expedient to look out for some employment
which might contribute to my support. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
therefore made inquiry among the law offices, and
was referred to Mr. Preston, an eminent conveyancer
in King’s Bench Walk, who engaged me as
a transcribing clerk at a guinea a week. I attended
the office from ten till five daily, and spent my evenings
in rational recreation. I must here observe
that the office of Mr. Preston was within two doors
of the chambers of Messrs. Dalton and Edwards,
the latter of whom had engaged me for the Bury
expedition; and it was certainly an act of impolicy
in me to accept a situation so immediately contiguous,
after the manner in which I had behaved to
Mr. Dalton, as it was highly probable the latter
would write to Mr. Edwards, and desire him to use
means for my apprehension. However this never
once struck me, or if it did, I thought it possible
that I might, in a place so constantly thronged with
passengers, go and come unobserved by him a thousand
times. In addition to this, I had never been
seen by Mr. Edwards but in that one interview, which
lasted but half an hour; and I had assumed on that
occasion, the name of Smith, whereas I had now
resumed my own. But fate had decreed that I
should suffer for my want of caution, and thus it
happened.</p>

<p>In going to and from the office of Mr. Preston,
I passed commonly four times a day by the chambers
of Dalton and Edwards, but the avenue in
front of the latter being very extensive, I always<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
contrived to give them a wide birth, as the sailors
term it, and their chambers being on the first floor,
it was not likely that I should be observed, who was
so much below them, and surrounded by numbers of
persons continually passing. It happened, however,
that my way to and from the office, lay through a
narrow passage called Mitre Court, leading into
Fleet Street. In this passage I frequently encountered
a young man having the appearance of a lawyer’s
clerk, whose face I thought I was familiar
with; and he, on his part, always looked earnestly at
me. As this was by no means uncommon amongst
young men similarly employed, I concluded he had
known me by sight, during my service in a former
office, and therefore paid no attention to the circumstance.</p>

<p>One morning, about nine weeks after my return
from Bury, I entered the office at the usual hour,
and I had scarcely taken my seat at the desk, when
Mr. Preston opening the door of his own apartment,
which was immediately adjoining that in
which the clerks wrote, desired me to step into his
room, which I should not have thought extraordinary,
had not he at the same moment placed himself
between me and the outer door leading to the street,
and made a motion with his hand for me to walk in
first: I had, therefore, no alternative, but entered the
room. Mr. Preston followed, and, immediately
shutting the door, locked it after him; upon which<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
I turned my head, and saw, to my no small surprise
and confusion, Mr. Dalton himself from Bury St.
Edmund’s. That gentleman advanced towards me,
and began to reproach me in strong terms for my misconduct;
then seeing the chain of my watch hanging
out, he immediately drew it from my fob, saying that
he should restore it to the person whom I had defrauded
of it. He next desired to know what I had
done with his trunk of clothes: at first I maintained
a sullen silence, and then denied any knowledge of
his meaning: upon which he assured me that he
had strong proofs; that if I did not restore them
he would prosecute, and transport me at the least;
but that it was probable I should be hanged for
forging a post-mark to the letter; for that the book-keeper
at the Blue Boar would swear to my person,
and that I had shewn him a post-mark which induced
him to deliver the portmanteau. I smiled at the
latter part of this threat, knowing the law too well
to be intimidated by it; but upon Mr. Dalton
observing that he knew where I lodged, and doubted
not of finding traces of the property, on searching
my apartment, I gave myself up for lost, as I had imprudently
preserved all the duplicates of the articles
pledged, which were now deposited in my bureau.
I, however, continued mute, and Mr. Dalton requested
Mr. Preston to send one of his clerks for
a constable; on the arrival of whom, he gave me in
charge, and, accompanied by both gentlemen, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
walked to my lodgings, the young man I formerly mentioned
(who proved to be a clerk to Messrs. Dalton
and Edwards, and who, as well as Mr. Edwards,
were also sent for by Mr. Preston,) leading the way.</p>

<p>I afterwards ascertained that Mr. Dalton having,
on my elopement, come to a knowledge of the frauds
I had practised on the Bury tradesmen, and by some
accident found out that his trunk had not been received
by Mr. Lyne, had written to Mr. Edwards
an account of the whole, and that his clerk having
recollected my person, had watched me home a
few days before; and Mr. Dalton having then been
summoned to town, had arrived that very morning,
and proceeded to apprehend me.</p>

<p>Having entered my apartment, Mr. Dalton demanded
my keys, which, as I found it useless longer to dissimulate,
I gave up, and my drawers being searched,
the unlucky duplicates were immediately found, and
in my trunk two or three articles of apparel, which I
had intended to have had altered for my own wear,
and which Mr. Dalton identified. I therefore confessed
the truth, and that those duplicates would
lead to the recovery of all the property, except the
uniform, which I had sold to a Jew, (in the street I
said, but this was because I would not implicate the
man, who kept a respectable sale-shop near Covent-garden,)
and the portmanteau itself, which I told him
I had destroyed. Mr. Dalton had now some conversation
with the constable apart, the result of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
was, that the latter was ordered to retain me in
custody; and this officer pretending to pity my
youth, and to wish, if possible, that the affair might
be compromised without public disgrace, offered to
confine me in his own house, which was in Chancery-lane,
till Mr. Dalton had considered further on the
subject. This having been agreed to, I accompanied
the constable to his house, where I had an
apartment assigned me, and was left (like Captain
Macheath,) to my private meditations: these, it
may be conjectured, were not the most agreeable, as
this was the first time of my ever being “in durance
vile.”</p>

<p>I heard no more of Mr. Dalton till the next
morning, when I was not a little surprised to see him
accompanied by my friend Mr. Presland. It seems
that the former, prior to his apprehending me, had
an interview with my landlady in Roll’s buildings,
and had learnt from her, that she had obtained a
character of me from the latter gentleman, on my
taking her apartments. Mr. Dalton in consequence,
after consigning me to the constable’s care, had waited
on Mr. Presland, and informed him of the disgraceful
situation in which I was then placed. The
result of their interview was the visit I am now going
to describe. Mr. Presland, after expressing his concern
at the state in which he saw me, and his anxious
wish to save me from the disgrace of a public prosecution,
inquired if I could undertake to recover<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the whole of Mr. Dalton’s property, in case I was
furnished with pecuniary means; on my answering
in the affirmative, (with the exceptions before mentioned,)
this truly generous friend told me that Mr.
Dalton had consented to forego a prosecution, provided
he had his property restored, and was reimbursed
the expenses of his journey to London and
back again; and that, from motives of regard for the
credit of our family, he, Mr. Presland, had agreed to
disburse a sum of money adequate to the occasion,
and would trust to the chance of being repaid by
my relations at some future period, when he had
broke the matter to them in as delicate a manner as
possible. He added, that he trusted my future
conduct would never again place me in so perilous
and dishonourable a situation. I, of course, expressed
the most heartfelt gratitude for such an
act of unmerited generosity, and it was settled that
the constable should immediately attend me to the
different pawnbrokers’ at which the articles were
pledged, for the purpose of redeeming them. I was
accordingly supplied with money by Mr. Presland,
and having received the duplicates, we set out on
our expedition. As I had pledged the property in
various parts of the town, and some of them very
remote, this task occupied three whole days, during
which time I dieted and lodged at the constable’s
house, my kind relation having become responsible
for every expense. The whole of the articles<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
pledged having been redeemed, were restored to Mr.
Dalton, and Mr. Presland indemnified that gentleman
for those which were irrecoverable. The aggregate
of the expense incurred on this occasion, including
principal and interest to the pawnbrokers,
expenses to Mr. Dalton, and compensation to the
constable for his attendance, amounted to upwards of
thirty pounds. Every thing being finally settled, I
was seriously admonished by Mr. Presland, who, on
my enlargement from custody, presented me with
five guineas, and made me promise that I would
immediately set out for S⸺shire, and endeavour
to obtain an appointment in the country;
being much afraid, he said, that if I continued in
town, my total ruin would be the inevitable consequence.</p>

<p><i>Obtain an Employment as Clerk and Shopman.—Rob

of Money.—Quit this Service, and am soon after
taken in custody, and committed to the Bastille<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the promise I had
given Mr. Presland, I could not reconcile myself to
the S⸺shire journey; the shame I felt at having
quitted my honourable station in the navy, as well
as some other reasons, and perhaps, above all, the
unavoidable destiny which awaited me, concurred
to prevent my taking the salutary advice of my
worthy and respected friend. Having, therefore,
privately changed my place of abode, I began to
consider how I should procure another employment
in town, and for this purpose I carefully examined the
advertisements in the daily papers, my intention being
now to enter into a mercantile clerkship, or to engage
as assistant in a retail shop, hoping thereby (with
shame I confess it,) to have a better opportunity of
realizing money by fraud or robbery, than I could expect
in the restricted capacity of an attorney’s clerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>At length I met with an advertisement, stating
that a young man who had a general knowledge
of business, was wanted in a retail shop, but particularly
requiring an undeniable character for honesty,
<i>&amp;c.</i> This latter clause seemed to promise some
difficulty, as I knew not where to give a reference,
except among the lawyers, and I was fearful that
I should not be approved of, if it was known that I
had been chiefly employed in that profession. However,
as I knew myself to have a talent for business,
and that I should soon acquire an insight, let the
branch be what it would, I determined to have
recourse to stratagem, to surmount the obstacle of
a recommendation.</p>

<p>I therefore obtained a reference to the advertiser
Mr. Giffard, who kept a large masquerade and
habit warehouse in Tavistock-street. This person,
who was a grave elderly man, inquired in what
capacity, and with whom I had been last employed;
being prepared for this question, I answered that I
had lived for the last two years with Mr. Drake, a
general shopkeeper in High-street, Portsmouth;
and that, in consequence of a family misfortune,
my late master had declined business, and retired
upon his means: that this was the only cause of my
being out of employment, and that Mr. Drake had
promised to answer any gentleman who might refer
to him as to my abilities and moral character. I
added, that having formerly lived in London with<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
my parents, I had still a sufficient knowledge of the
town, to render myself useful to my employer. After
a few more questions, which I answered with becoming
modesty and propriety, Mr. Giffard told me
he liked my appearance well, that he would write
that evening to Mr. Drake, and ordered that I should
call again in two days’ time, when, if he approved
of the answer he received, he would immediately
engage me.</p>

<p>Having proceeded thus far before the wind, I had
now to take measures for bringing my plot to a
happy conclusion. My next object was to obtain
possession of Mr. Giffard’s letter, in order that I
might answer it myself, Mr. Drake being a person
who existed only in my inventive brain: this I accomplished
in the following manner. I found out
the guard of the Portsmouth mail-coach, who was
to quit London that evening, and return to town the
next day but one. I obtained the ear of this man,
by inviting him to partake of some brandy and
water, and then introduced my business by acquainting
him that my name was Drake, that I had lately
resided in Portsmouth, and that I had reason to
suppose there was one or more letters lying at the
post-office in that town for me, as I knew no such
person was now to be found in High-street; I
therefore requested that he would, on his arrival,
make inquiry for such letters, and bring any he
might find safe to me on his return, promising a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
gratification for his trouble: this commission he
readily undertook, and we then separated.</p>

<p>On the day appointed, I met my trusty agent,
who delivered me the expected letter, for which I
amply rewarded him. On perusing this epistle, it
was such as might be expected on the like occasion,
Mr. Giffard concluding his inquiries with wishing
to know, if the applicant John Smith (which name
I had now assumed,) was in every respect fit to be
received into a respectable house. I had now half
accomplished the business, and it only remained to
return a suitable answer through the regular channel;
but to save appearances, and gain time, I waited immediately
on Mr. Giffard desiring to know if he had
received a reply from Mr. Drake. On his answering
in the negative, I expressed much surprise, but accounted
for it, by informing him that Mr. Drake was
probably absent from home, on a visit to some relations
a few miles distant, and that on his return, he
would not fail to transmit an answer. Having thus
satisfied Mr. Giffard, I departed, promising to wait
on him every day until the expected letter arrived.</p>

<p>I now applied myself to frame an answer, which
I at length completed to my satisfaction, having
disguised my hand-writing as much as possible. In
this letter, I made Mr. Drake apologize for his delay,
by stating that he was from home when Mr. Giffard’s
favour arrived, and had taken up his pen the moment
it came to hand, to answer his inquiries; that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
felt happy at hearing the young man was likely to
obtain so respectable a situation, and it gave him the
highest gratification to bear testimony to his exemplary
conduct on all occasions, while he had been
in his service; that his abilities were such as could
not fail to render him an acquisition, and that he
should not himself have parted with him on any
account, had he not, for private reasons, declined
business. Finally, Mr. Drake declared himself glad
that I had so soon met with a situation, as London
was a bad place for a young person to be long out
of employment, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Having finished this epistle, and directed it in due
form, I hastened to find out the driver of the mail-coach,
as I did not choose to employ the guard on
this occasion. I requested the coachman to take
this letter to Portsmouth, and on his arrival to drop
it in the post-office, giving some fictitious reason,
which fully satisfied him, when backed by a small
compliment in silver.</p>

<p>I continued to call every morning on Mr. Giffard,
and expressed such well-feigned sorrow at Mr. Drake’s
delay, that I really believe the former would in
a few days more have taken me without the required
testimonials. However, the long expected answer
at length arrived; and on my calling as usual, Mr.
Giffard told me with great marks of pleasure, that he
had just received a letter from Mr. Drake, who
gave me so excellent a character, that I might come<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
that very day if I was prepared. Mr. Giffard
further informed me that he was on the point himself
of leaving the business to the management of
his two partners, (Fisher and Pettit) and should retire
to a country-house he possessed at Hammersmith:
that as one of these partners only resided
in the house, and he was a bachelor, it would be
necessary that I should board myself, for which expense
I should be allowed fifteen shillings a week,
and for my services twelve more. Though this
allowance was comparatively trifling, I agreed to the
terms, as my only intention was to purloin all I
could lay my hands on, and in two or three months
to abscond, and change the scene of action. As to
my duty, it was to attend the shop, to make out
bills of parcels, keep a set of books, and occasionally
to carry out light packages.</p>

<p>I immediately brought my trunk of clothes, <i>&amp;c.</i>,
to the house, and had a small bureau bedstead
assigned me in a little room behind the shop; in which
room during the day, a number of young women
were employed in making up fancy-habits, character-dresses,
dominos, <i>&amp;c.</i> In a few days Mr.
Giffard, with his family, left the house, and there
only remained Mr. Pettit, the junior partner, myself,
and a woman servant. The second partner (Fisher,)
was a tailor, who superintended thirty or forty
men, constantly employed in a large workshop on
the attic story, in making gentlemen’s clothes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
ladies’ riding-habits. The stair-case to the upper
apartments communicated with the shop, and had a
door at the bottom, which when Mr. Pettit and the
servant were gone to bed, I could fasten with a bolt
so as to leave me at liberty to range the shop, and
examine every part of its contents. Of this opportunity
I soon availed myself, and the keys of the
various drawers, <i>&amp;c.</i>, being left below, I proceeded
to reconnoitre the different articles they contained.</p>

<p>I found these to consist of black and white lace,
of various breadths and descriptions; ribands, silk,
and other haberdashery; a large quantity of mode,
Persians, gauze, muslin, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> There were also
masks and dominos of every kind for the purpose of
hire on masquerade nights, but these articles were
of no value to me. As to the cloths, and other
materials for gentlemen’s clothes, these were always
sent for, together with the requisite trimmings,
from various shops in the neighbourhood, at which
tailors are supplied with such goods, as they have
need of them; and it frequently fell to my lot to
fetch these articles, on which occasion I had only to
take the pattern-books, and point out the quantities
of each kind wanted, when (after it was known that
I lived with Giffard and Co.) the same was immediately
measured, booked, and given to me.</p>

<p>Having found out a Jew salesman resident in the
neighbourhood, who agreed to purchase whatever
goods I brought to him, I began my depredations by<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
taking a piece of elegant black mode, and several
cards of lace, which articles I concealed in my bedstead,
until I went out to breakfast the ensuing morning,
when (this being the winter season,) I buttoned
them up under my great-coat so as not to be perceived.
On going to the Jew receiver, this conscientious
Israelite, who no doubt suspected how I had obtained
these articles, and my ignorance of their real
value, offered me a guinea for each card of lace,
(containing above twenty yards,) which was probably
about the selling price of a single yard; and an
equally equitable price for the mode; protesting
“as he was an honest man, <i>and hoped for shalvation</i>,”
that he could not afford sixpence more. As
I had no alternative, I was obliged to accept the proffered
sum, and promised to let him have more goods
of the same kind, at every opportunity. I continued
this course of pillage for several weeks,
taking care, however, not to meddle too freely with
any one species of property, so as to cause a discovery.
As to money, I had not the means of getting
any, for there was very little retail trade in this shop;
and that little was confined to a few persons of
fashion, who came in their carriages, and were
always waited on by Mr. Pettit; besides this class
of persons seldom pay ready money for the articles
they select, but have them booked. The various
goods I have mentioned, were chiefly kept for the
purpose of making up, and ornamenting the masquerade<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
and fancy-dresses, which were from time
to time bespoke for extraordinary occasions.</p>

<p>I was frequently sent home with a suit of clothes,
a lady’s-habit, and other articles, to the houses of
regular customers; most of whom kept an accompt,
which was settled once a year: but on
many occasions I was desired by the parties to give
a receipt and take the amount of the goods delivered.
After being about two months with Messrs.
Giffard and Co., I began to form the design of
quitting their service, and from that moment I suppressed
all such sums as I received, booking the
articles on my return, for the satisfaction of Mr.
Pettit, who conducted this department. I now
bespoke a very large chest of a neighbouring carpenter,
for the purpose of depositing my own
clothes and other effects, which I knew must be
removed by degrees from the house; and that
whenever I absconded, I must leave my trunk
behind me. I therefore had recourse to the old
stratagem of substituting brickbats for the articles
I took away, to prevent any suspicion from its lightness.
When my chest was completed, I ordered
it to be sent home to a lodging I had provided in a
distant part of the town, of which I had obtained the
key, and paid rent in advance. I removed my effects
at every opportunity from Tavistock-street, to this
new receptacle. Every thing being in readiness
for an elopement, I prepared to execute my last<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
design upon my present employers. I have before
observed that I kept a set of books, in which were the
accounts of many persons of fashion for clothes, <i>&amp;c.</i>
My intention was to transcribe from the ledger a
number of these accounts upon the copper-plate
bills of parcels, which I had in my desk, belonging
to the firm, and to present these bills for payment,
immediately after I quitted the house; not doubting
but many of the parties would pay them on the first
application, by which I hoped to realize a good round
sum. But circumstances not favouring this part
of my design, I had only an opportunity of transcribing
five or six persons’ bills before Saturday
night, at which period the books were delivered up
to Mr. Pettit, who uniformly retained them until
Monday morning; and, as I had reason to fear my
repeated depredations on the shop would soon excite
suspicion, I had pre-determined to quit on the
day last mentioned.</p>

<p>The last commission I received on the Saturday
was to take a parcel, containing a riding-habit, to
the Bell and Crown inn, Holborn, where I was to
see it booked for the Clapham stage, at which place
the lady resided, for whom it was made. As I was
going along, it occurred to me that I might as well
embezzle this article, the price of which to the lady
was 5<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Instead, therefore, of going to the
Bell and Crown, I took it to my old acquaintance
the Jew, who, I expected, would give me at least<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
two guineas for it; but he had the conscience to offer
me one pound, which I considered so unfair a price
that I refused to let him have it, and, leaving his
shop, I proceeded to a pawnbroker’s a few doors
further, where I requested two guineas upon it; but
the shopman assured me these articles were so liable
to the caprice of the fashion, that it might scarce be
saleable at all in a year’s time, except to convert to
some other use; he therefore offered to lend me thirty
shillings, which I accepted, to save further trouble.
This was the most imprudent act I could have been
guilty of, as this pawnbroker’s was in Drury-lane,
and within a minute’s walk of my employer’s; and
I had better have taken ten shillings from the Jew,
where it would have been placed beyond the reach
of discovery, than have pledged it for five times the
sum. The consequence of this imprudence will be
seen by-and-by.</p>

<p>On my return to Tavistock-street, I informed
Mr. Pettit that I had seen the parcel safely booked.
The same night after he had retired to bed, I selected
a few of the most eligible articles in the shop as
my farewell adventure, which I concealed in my
bed till the next morning, Sunday, when I conveyed
them to the usual place of disposal.</p>

<p>Monday being come, I attended in the shop till
the hour of breakfast, when I went out as usual, but
with no intention of returning. I had previously
procured several patterns of fancy quilting for<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
waistcoats, and of the most fashionable articles for
breeches; with these I immediately went to the
houses, at which we were usually furnished with
such goods, and shewing my patterns, (my person
being well known,) I was immediately supplied
with what I asked for, and the articles booked to
Messrs. Giffard and Co. I proceeded in like
manner to a woollen-draper’s, where I obtained a
few yards of superfine cloth; and afterwards to a
trimming and button warehouse, at which I procured
suitable materials for making up the whole,
as I intended these articles for my own wear. All
this was executed within the hour I usually allotted
for breakfast.</p>

<p>I next visited my lodging, and, depositing my
newly-acquired property in my chest, informed the
landlady I should come to sleep in the apartment
that night. Having taken some breakfast, I hastened
to present my bills at the West end of the town,
and was so fortunate as to receive about twenty
pounds, besides an order at another house to call
again the next day, which, as I had no immediate
danger to apprehend, I, in fact, did, and received a
few pounds more. For the whole of these sums, I
gave receipts on account of Messrs. Giffard and Co.</p>

<p>Thus ended my engagement with Mr. Giffard,
after a duration of about ten weeks. I was now possessed
of a pretty good stock of clothes, and about sixty
pounds in money. I had lived well during the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
period of my service; and I now determined to enjoy
every amusement the town afforded, as I had lately
been debarred from attending the theatres, <i>&amp;c.</i> on
account of my being restricted to early hours.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after my quitting Tavistock-street,
I called at the pawnbroker’s, at which I had
pledged the riding-habit, for the purpose of buying
some fancy silk-handkerchiefs, of which they had
a very extensive assortment, being unredeemed
pledges. On entering the shop, I found it very
full of people, (this being Saturday evening,) and
the shopman desired I would wait a short time,
and he would then attend to me. In a few minutes
I heard the latter desire an apprentice to take a bag
and go to a neighbouring liquor-shop, for the purpose
of procuring ten pounds worth of silver. I thought
I perceived something significant in the shopman’s
manner of giving these directions, but as nothing is
more common than such a proceeding on a Saturday
night, when the pawnbrokers have need of a great
deal of change, I had no apprehension of any deceit.
When I began to grow impatient, the young man
at length sent a boy up stairs to bring down the
handkerchiefs, for my inspection; finding, however,
that he was in no hurry to descend with them, and
conceiving at last, that I was only kept in suspense
for some sinister purpose, I declared that I would
wait no longer, but call again another time. Turning
about to leave the shop, who should I encounter<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
at the door, to my great confusion, but my late
master, Mr. Pettit, accompanied by a Bow-street
officer, and the boy who had pretended to go out
for the silver. I attempted to rush by them, but
was overpowered and secured. The officer immediately
proceeded to search me, but found nothing
of a suspicious nature: he took, however, some
loose money, and every other article I had about
me; luckily I had some money (the bulk of my
fortune,) in a private pocket, which he did not discover.
Mr. Pettit then asked the pawnbroker if I
was the person who had pledged the habit, and on
his answering in the affirmative, I was given in
charge to the officer, who conducted me to Covent-garden
watch-house, where I was to remain locked
up until the magistrate sat in the evening, at the
public-office, Bow-street.</p>

<p>Shortly after my confinement, I received a visit
from Mr. Pettit, who, after expatiating on the
enormity of my conduct, told me he had detected
the frauds I had practised at the neighbouring shops,
and demanded what I had done with the property
so obtained. This, however, I refused to tell, not
supposing that he had any idea of my place of abode:
but in this I found myself unhappily mistaken, for
he informed me that he had discovered it by means
of the porter employed to carry home my chest, who,
it seems, was well acquainted with Mr. Pettit, and
had seen me frequently in his shop. On receiving<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
this unwelcome information, I told Mr. Pettit to
take what steps he pleased; and refused to answer
any interrogatories, which I knew would avail me
nothing, without a full restitution, which I was
unable to make.</p>

<p>About six o’clock I was taken before the sitting
magistrate, and Mr. Pettit, being duly sworn, related
the whole story of the riding-habit, and stated that a
few days after my elopement, he was surprised at
receiving a message from the lady, respecting the delay
in sending it home; and having inquired at the
office of the inn, he was assured that no such parcel
had been booked or brought there; that having
reason, from my sudden disappearance, to suspect
my honesty, he had made inquiry at the surrounding
pawnbrokers, and had found the habit pledged at
the shop of Mr. Lane, in Drury-lane, who, on his
application, had immediately restored it. The shopman
of Mr. Lane deposed, that he had taken in the
article of me, and the magistrate observed that the
evidence was so clear, that nothing now remained but
for Mr. Pettit to produce and identify the property.
The latter replied that he had it not in his possession,
having sent it home to the lady, who was
urgent to receive it. At this the magistrate expressed
great displeasure, informing the prosecutor
that all he had said was to no purpose, without the
property being produced, and that he was therefore
not warranted in committing me. Then turning to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
me, he said, “Young man, you have had a very
narrow escape; I hope this will be a warning to
you in future. Officer, let the prisoner be discharged.”
My joy at this deliverance was but momentary,
for before I could reach the door of the
office, Mr. Pettit acquainted the magistrate, that he
had several other charges of fraud against me, but the
parties were not then in attendance; upon which
his worship ordered me to be detained, and directing
that the witnesses should attend on that day
week, ordered my mittimus to be made out, and
committed me to the house of correction for another
examination.</p>

<p>On entering the gates of the gloomy receptacle
to which I was now consigned, and which on many
accounts has not been unaptly named the Bastille,
the sensations I felt may be more easily conceived
than described. Besides that this was the first
prison I had ever entered, every thing around me
had an air of unspeakable horror. After being
viewed and reviewed by the surly Cerberuses of
this earthly hell, I was conducted up some stairs
to a long gallery, or passage, six feet wide, having
on either side a number of dismal cells, each about
six feet by nine, formed entirely of stone, but having
a small grated window near the roof, at the further
end, which admitted a gloomy light, and overlooked
a yard, in which other prisoners were confined;
there was also a similar grate over the door; but,
owing to their height, both these apertures were<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
very difficult of access. The cells on the other side
the passage, were exactly similar, but overlooking
another yard, and the doors were immediately
opposite each other. The only furniture of these
dreary apartments was an iron bedstead, on which
were a bed, blanket, and rug, but all of the coarsest
kind. I afterwards found, that by paying an extravagant
price, I might have had better accommodation;
but as I had then only a few days to stop,
and I found no want of cleanliness in my present
lodging, I declined the favour. My conductor
having given me a pitcher of water, without vouchsafing
a word, locked the door, and left me in utter
darkness. I retired to my homely couch, and
having well refreshed myself before I left the Brown
Bear<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, I soon forgot my misfortunes in the arms of
Morpheus, and did not awake till I was roused by
the turnkey, at a late hour in the morning. This
personage now behaved with some little civility,
and let me know that if I had any money I might be
supplied with a good breakfast; at the same time
tossing upon my bed a small loaf (about fourteen
ounces,) of bread, which he told me was the daily
allowance of the prison. I gladly accepted his
offer, and desired to have some tea, which was presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
sent up to me; and I continued to have three
tolerable good meals, (at least in quantity,) every
day during my stay here; but I paid for each on
delivery, and through the nose.</p>

<p>In order to amuse my mind during this solitary
week, I climbed up to the grated aperture over the
door of my cell, and listened to the conversation of the
neighbouring prisoners, who were also confined for
re-examination; and from their discourse I acquired a
more extensive knowledge of the various modes of
fraud and robbery, which I now found were reduced
to a regular system, than I should have done in
seven years, had I continued at large. I was indeed
astonished at what I heard, and I clearly perceived
that instead of expressing contrition for their offences,
their only consideration was how to proceed with
more safety, but increased vigour, in their future depredations.
And here I was struck with the fallacious
notions entertained by the projectors of this
prison, which was reputed to be upon the plan of
the benevolent and immortal Howard, who had recommended
the confinement of offenders in separate
cells, in order to prevent the effects of evil communication
among persons who had not all attained an
equal degree of depravity. This object, however,
was not effected here, for being within hearing of
each other, they could, by sitting up over the door
as I have described, converse each with his opposite
neighbour, and even form a line of communication,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
where the discourse became general, from
one end of the gallery to the other. As a proof of
what I have advanced, I knew several of the
prisoners then confined with me in this passage,
who were at that time but striplings, and novices in
villany, and who after several years’ continuance in
their evil courses, at length became notorious offenders,
and having narrowly escaped a shameful death,
are now prisoners for life in this colony.</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointed day, I was again
taken to Bow-street, where I found in attendance
Mr. Pettit, and the three shopkeepers from whom
I had obtained the goods. I also saw to my mortification,
that they had searched my lodging, and
had actually the various articles so obtained in their
custody, ready to produce. The first person who
came forward, was the woollen-draper’s shopman,
who, producing some yards of cloth and kerseymere,
deposed that I had applied for such articles in the
name of Messrs. Giffard and Co., and that having frequently
served me with the like goods, he delivered
them to me without hesitation. Mr. Pettit then
denying that I had been deputed by him, or his
partner, and the property being sworn to, the
magistrate observed that here was sufficient matter
to convict me, and it was therefore unnecessary to
bind over the other tradesmen, who were ordered
to retain their goods. Having nothing to offer in
my defence, his worship ordered the clerk to commit<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
me for trial, on which I earnestly begged the
magistrate to send me to some other prison, where
my friends might have access to me, (this being
denied at the Bastille à la mode de Paris,) and in
compliance with my request, I was ordered to New
Prison, Clerkenwell; at which I was much rejoiced.</p>

<p>On arriving at this prison, of the rules of which
I had acquired some idea, from the information of
my late fellow prisoners, who had indeed advised
me to petition as I did, I desired to have the best
accommodation I could, and was therefore called
upon to pay fees, garnish, <i>&amp;c.</i>, together with two
shillings for a bed the first night, but after that, one
shilling only. Having complied with every demand,
I was introduced to a little room adjoining the
turnkey’s lodge, where I found several persons in
my own predicament, and some others who were confined
for certain periods. We spent the day together
in this part of the prison, having also free
access to the lodge, in which we walked for air, and
at night were locked up in different rooms above
stairs, each containing two or three tolerable beds;
so that having society both night and day, I felt less
melancholy than I had done in the house of correction.
My first care was to send for a young man,
who, being reputed honest by the world, I thought I
could intrust to arrange matters at my lodgings,
and take care of the effects I left in my apartment.
I requested him to pay the rent due, and remove<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
my chest to his own residence, supplying me occasionally
with such articles as I might need.
On his return, he informed me that he had done
everything for the best; but, from his report, I found
that twenty guineas in money, and many of my
best clothes, had taken flight. This he attributed
to the officers, who, he said, had paid several
visits to the chest, on pretence of searching by
authority. As I knew how fruitless any complaint
would be, I was obliged to submit to these losses,
and thought myself very fortunate in having
thirty pounds about me on my apprehension,
which escaped the fangs of the officer who searched
me.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of April when I was
taken up, and this being what is termed long vacation,
I had nearly seven weeks to lie in jail, before
the sessions came on. This time I passed in the
most agreeable manner I could, reading sometimes
books and newspapers, at others, smoking, drinking,
and conversing with my fellow-prisoners;
having all plenty of money, we formed a pretty
respectable mess, and lived on the most sociable
terms. Our society was increased by several new
chums before the sessions, and as these persons
were some degrees above the common class of
thieves, I found much satisfaction in their conversation.
There were indeed among them some of
the first characters upon the town, leading men in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
various branches of prigging<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> they professed; both
toby-gills<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, buz-gloaks<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
    cracksmen<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, but from
their good address and respectable appearance,
nobody would suspect their real vocation. As for
the unfortunate prisoners, who had no money to
pay for indulgence, they were confined in a large
yard, called the common side, where they were indeed
exposed to “variety of wretchedness.” The
part I inhabited was termed “between gates,” being
that space which is between the outer-gate of the
prison, and the gate leading to the common-side.</p>

<p>My knowledge of life, as it is termed by the
knavish part of mankind, and my acquaintance with
family people<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, every day increased; but, as all who
heard my case concurred with myself in opinion
that I had no chance of escaping conviction, I did
not form any intimacy, or devise any plans beyond
the present moment, concluding that I should, at
least, be confined for two years, if not transported
for seven.</p>

<p>A week before the Old Bailey sessions, the
prisoners were as usual removed to Newgate; but
to my surprise, I was not included in their number;
and I found that my offence being considered a misdemeanour,
I was to be tried at the Quarter sessions<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
held at Hicks’s-hall. For the reason before-mentioned,
I had been advised not to employ a counsel,
which indeed I conceived would be only money
thrown away, as the case was too clear against me.
I therefore patiently awaited the issue, and the day
of trial being come, I was taken, with many other
prisoners of both sexes, from the prison to the
sessions-house on Clerkenwell-green, at which Mr.
Mainwaring, the member for Middlesex, has for
many years presided as chairman.</p>

<p>Being put to the bar, I stood indicted for knowingly
and designedly, and by false pretences, obtaining
from Joseph Addington, five yards of superfine
blue cloth, and three yards of black kerseymere, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Having pleaded “Not guilty,” the first witness
called, was Henry York, shopman to the prosecutor,
who deposed, that on the 7th of April, I came to
his master’s shop, and said I wanted the articles
mentioned in the indictment; and that he, the
witness, knowing me well by sight, as the servant of
Messrs. Giffard and Co., and taking for granted
that I was still in their service, immediately cut off,
and delivered the same to me. Here the chairman
pressed the witness repeatedly, to state the exact
words that I used; but the man was so evidently
embarrassed, (I suppose from his never being before
in a court of justice,) that nothing more could be
extracted from him; he would persist in speaking
only in the third person. “He said he wanted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
<i>&amp;c.</i>” Indeed, to the best of my recollection, he had
sworn exactly the truth; but the reader will soon
see the chairman’s motive for wishing his evidence
to be more pointed. I now felt my hopes revive, and
Mr. Pettit being sworn to depose that he had not
empowered me to demand the said goods, which
were now produced and identified, I was put upon
my defence, upon which I addressed the court to
the following effect: “May it please your worship,
and gentlemen of the jury, I am here indicted for
obtaining goods under false pretences. From the
evidence of the witness York, you hear of no pretences
whatever which I used; he merely swears that
I said I wanted such and such articles, and that he
delivered them to me without scruple. However, I
may have been morally culpable, I hope, gentlemen,
you will only be guided in your verdict by the evidence
before you, and I humbly submit that the
charge against me has not been formally substantiated.
Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands,
and the question of law to the learned chairman,
who, I am persuaded, will impartially decide
thereon.”</p>

<p>The chairman now addressing the jury, spoke as
follows: “Gentlemen, I am sorry, for the ends of
public justice, that there is but too much reason in
what the prisoner has advanced; but he is a very
young man, and I sincerely hope that if he this day
escapes the correction of the law, he will never again<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
transgress in a similar way. Gentlemen, the prisoner
is charged in the indictment with falsely obtaining
these goods in the names of William Giffard,
Christopher Fisher, and James Orrell Pettit. Now
in the evidence of York, the shopman, we hear not
a syllable of such pretence, or of the prisoner using
either of those names, consequently, the case is not
made out, and you must acquit the prisoner.” This
they immediately did, and after an admonition from
the chairman, I was discharged, having first applied
for the money, <i>&amp;c.</i>, taken from me on my apprehension,
which the court ordered to be restored.
Mr. Pettit seemed much chagrined at my escape,
and I was in some fear that he would endeavour to
have me detained; but it is probable that he thought
it not worth his while, as he could not hope to obtain
any restitution from me; however, he suffered
me to depart in peace, to my great joy. I have
reason to believe that he had not discovered the full
extent of my depredations on his property at this
time, and that he had not yet come to a knowledge
of the money I received in payment of bills at the
West end of the town.</p>

<p>On regaining my liberty, my first step was to go
in quest of the person to whose care I had consigned
my effects; and who, on pretence of much
business, had abstained for a fortnight past, from
visiting me in the prison. Inquiring at his usual
place of abode, I found that he had quitted his<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
lodging a few days after the period of my apprehension,
and the people of the house knew not
where he was gone. I then called at the printing-office
in which he was employed when I first knew
him, and there learnt that he had suddenly absented
himself, and was reported to have engaged with
some person of that profession in the country.
Every inquiry I could make was equally fruitless,
and I had the mortification to find that this supposed
friend had treacherously converted all my little
property to his own use, without regard to the
helpless situation in which he left me. I had no
longer any doubts about the fate of my twenty
guineas, and articles of apparel, which he had persuaded
me the officers must have purloined.</p>

<p>My situation was now deplorable enough; I
possessed only the clothes on my back, and about
five pounds in money, the expenses of living, <i>&amp;c.</i>,
during my confinement, having consumed the rest of
my stock. However, I had regained my freedom,
which I little expected, and I consoled myself with the
reflection that I might have been still worse off
than I really was. I engaged a cheap but decent
lodging, and furnished myself with such necessaries
as were indispensable for my present comfort, and
external appearance; and I next began to muse
upon the course now to be adopted for my future
subsistence.</p>

<p>A few days after my acquittal, I was accosted<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
one afternoon, in Fleet-street, by a young man,
whose face I had some faint recollection of; while
I was considering where I had seen him, he anticipated
me, by asking if I did not remember him in
New-prison, where he was confined on the common
side, and had frequently conversed with me through
the gate of the lodge, at which I sometimes amused
myself with viewing the proceedings in the yard below
me. This young man was then only confined till
the sessions on a charge of assault, but, being poor
in circumstances, was unable to pay the expenses
of admission “between gates.” I immediately recognised
him, and he gave me joy on my deliverance.
He was now very well attired, and invited me to
drink a glass; to which, as I had always found much
pleasure in his conversation, I willingly consented,
and accompanied him to a house, called the White
Swan, near Temple-bar. Here my inviter seemed
quite at home; he introduced me to a neat little
parlour, in which were a number of persons smoking
their pipes, and drinking wine, punch, <i>&amp;c.</i> I observed
that my conductor, whom I shall in future
call Bromley, appeared to know and be known by them
all, and that they regarded me with an inquiring eye.</p>

<p>Having taken our seats in a vacant part of the
room, our conversation was at first upon general
topics; at length Bromley inquired in a friendly
manner, how I employed myself, and on my answering
candidly, that I really was destitute of employment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
and almost of money, he observed that I was
to blame if I wanted money while any body else
had any; that for his part he never would; and
that if I would take a walk with him, I should be
welcome; he added that he had that day turned out
three readers<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, but without finding a shilling in
either of them; however, said he, we cannot expect
to be always equally lucky. I confess I was
ashamed to own that I had never practised thieving,
for (thanks to my late seven weeks’ education,)
I understood his meaning well. I therefore told
him that I had not been accustomed to buzzing, and
should be unable to do my part. On this, Bromley
replied that we should have at least one other person
with us, and that he himself would work, while
he only required me and the third man to cover<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
him. Having thus answered my objection, as I
had no scruples of conscience to overcome, I agreed
to accompany him. Shortly afterwards a genteel
looking man, advancing to our table, from among
the other company, asked Bromley if he was inclined
for a walk; at the same time looking significantly
first at me, then at my companion. The latter
answered, “Yes, sir, with all my heart; this gentleman
is a friend of mine, he’ll take a turn with us:
it’s all right: he’s one of us.” Bromley having<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
discharged our reckoning, we then set out, and
proceeded up Fleet-street, till we observed a crowd
of gazers at the windows of Messrs. Laurie and
Whittle, print-sellers. Bromley immediately joined
the throng, we keeping close behind him, wherever
he moved; at length he gave us a sign to cover,
and we had scarcely taken our stations, before
Bromley drew back, and pulling the skirt of my
coat, left the crowd, and crossing the way, turned
up a court which led into another street. We followed
him close, till he entered a public house, and
we were no sooner in a private room, than Bromley
drew from under his coat a large green pocket-book,
which, it seems, he had, unobserved by me, extracted
from the pocket of a gentleman by whose side
he stood, when we advanced to cover him. The
book, being opened, was found to contain a complete
set of valuable surgeon’s instruments, some
private letters, and other papers, and in one of the
pockets eleven pounds in bank notes; the money
was immediately divided in equal shares, and the
stranger observing that he knew where to fence<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the
book, allowed Bromley and myself five shillings
each on that account. The papers, <i>&amp;c.</i>, having
been committed to the flames, we then left the
house; but my two companions having observed
some police-officers in Fleet-street, deemed it imprudent
to prolong our stay in that quarter, and it being<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
now nearly dusk, at my request, we all three returned
to the White Swan, as I was curious to know more of
the various characters I had seen assembled there.</p>

<p>The seasonable relief my finances had experienced
by this adventure, without any exertion or
risk on my part, gave me much satisfaction; and I
thought, to use the words of Mrs. Peachum, in the
Beggar’s Opera, that this was “pretty encouragement
for a young beginner.”</p>

<p>It was no sooner dark and the candles lighted,
than the room began to fill apace, and my friend
Bromley gave me a description of each person as he
entered, explaining the various branches of prigging,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, in which they excelled, as well as their good or
bad dispositions towards each other. I recognised
among them several faces which I remembered to
have seen at different public places, and even at coffee-houses
and ordinaries, where they intermixed with
the best company, and were treated with every respect.</p>

<p>From this time Bromley and myself became inseparable.
This young man was the son of a respectable
master-tailor, and was himself bred to the
same trade. Having formed bad connexions, (the
usual root of all evil,) he had quitted his father’s
house about a year before I first knew him, and
associating with “family people,” had since supported
himself by depredation; he was two years older
than myself, and his father considering him irreclaimable,
had long since given him up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>For a few weeks we continued to go out<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
with one or other of the gentlemen frequenting the
Swan; and after I had made the first essay, I became
pretty expert in the art of buzzing. Our
success was various, but we managed to live well,
and I for my part soon acquired a good stock of
clothes, books, and other comforts, as they were
considered by me. As for Bromley, he was
not so good a manager, and when absent from me,
he led a very irregular life, lavishing his money
without discrimination on the most unworthy
objects, without taking any thought for the morrow,
so that though our gains were equal, I became
every day richer, while he was seldom master of
a guinea beforehand. By degrees we detached
ourselves from the society of those veteran prigs<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,
with whom we had first associated, and not confining
our operations to one branch of depredation,
we had recourse to various methods of getting
money. It would be tedious to particularize
every species of fraud and robbery, which we
practised in the short space of three months, at
the end of which period, it will be seen that the
hand of justice arrested our further progress; and
it is hardly credible, (but such is the fact,) that
during this our limited career, we exercised alternately
the following numerous modes of depredation;
which, least the reader should be unprovided<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
with a cant dictionary, I shall briefly explain in succession:
<i>viz.</i>, buzzing<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, dragging<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>,
    sneaking<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,
hoisting<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, pinching<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>,
    smashing<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, jumping<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>,
spanking<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, and starring<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>;
    together with the kid-rig<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>,
the letter-racket<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, the order-racket<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>,
and the snuff-racket<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>In these various exploits, we were sometimes assisted
by a third person; and at others, though very<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
rarely, we formed part of a numerous gang; but in
general we acted by ourselves, and, considering our
youth and inexperience, evinced a good deal of
dexterity.</p>

<p>In the month of July, 1800, finding myself inclined
for a summer excursion into the country, I
determined on a trip to Plymouth, having never been
in the West of England, and invited my friend
Bromley to accompany me. As we, neither of us,
possessed much money, I proposed to travel in the
same manner as I had formerly done, in my Portsmouth
expedition, and to defray our expenses by
practising the same imposition, which I now well
knew to be a systematic fraud, known among
“family people” by the title of “the letter-racket.”</p>

<p>We accordingly left town together, equipped
with a few indispensables, contained in a small
bundle which we carried alternately, and provided
with a new edition of “Carey’s Itinerary.” Our first
resting-place was Hammersmith, where, in the
course of four hours, I realized as many pounds;
my companion in the mean time lying dormant in
a public-house, for in this practice he was not qualified
to bear a part; but we intended to omit no
opportunity which might offer of obtaining money
by any other means.</p>

<p>Quitting Hammersmith, we proceeded to Hounslow,
where we arrived the same evening, and reposed
for the night. The following day was spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
in collecting from the well-disposed inhabitants of
the town, and on the ensuing morning, we walked to
Staines a distance of seven miles. Arriving at the latter
place about one o’clock, we put up at a genteel
public-house, and regaled ourselves with a good
dinner. We had just dined, and were enjoying a
pipe, and a bowl of punch, when a respectable
looking old gentleman entered the room, and begged,
if it was agreeable, to take a pipe with us. This
being a sort of public parlour, of course we could
have no objection, and we soon entered into familiar
chat, the stranger proving a very pleasant companion.
Having passed about an hour in conversation,
I rose, and, apologizing to the old gentleman,
told Bromley I would step out and transact a little
business, desiring him to entertain the stranger
until my return. My intention was to visit some of
the most respectable inhabitants with my petition,
and Bromley, of course, well understood my meaning.</p>

<p>On quitting the inn, which was situated in the
principal street, and about the centre of the town,
I turned to my right hand, towards London, proposing
to take the houses and shops on that side the
street, until I came to the extremity or entrance of
the town, and then to return on the other side, until
I arrived opposite our inn; calculating that this
task would occupy the remainder of that day, and
meaning on the next to make a circuit of the other
half of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>My first essay was at a watch-maker’s, about six
doors from the house at which we put up. Entering
the shop with my letter in my hand, I was
rather surprised at finding no person in attendance,
and still more so, when upon knocking on the
counter, not a soul appeared to answer me. Casting
my eyes round, I perceived a door of communication
with a back-room, in which I distinctly heard
a child crying, and the voice of a woman soothing
it. There were a number of watches hanging in
the window, and conceiving I ought to profit by this
opportunity, I determined without hesitation to do
so. Having, therefore, first slightly repeated my
knock, and then looked up and down the street, in
which (as frequently happens in country towns,)
not a creature appeared, I commenced my depredations.
The window, as is usual with watchmakers,
was enclosed with a kind of lattice-work, and there
was no means of access to the watches, but by a
small gate, which opened behind the counter. The
attempt was rather hazardous, but the temptation
predominated, and over the counter I jumped.
Having entered the little enclosure, I took down
the watch nearest to me, which was a silver one,
and put it in my pocket, then another, also silver,
and had just extended my hand towards a third,
which from the colour I supposed to be gold, when
lo! to my utter confusion, the very same old gentleman
I had left in the company of Bromley, advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
to the window, as if passing by; but stopping
short, and looking earnestly towards me for a
moment, he suddenly turned round, and appearing
much agitated, retraced his steps as fast as his age
would permit him towards the inn. This transaction
was of course momentary, and I had no time
for reflection; but the terror and alarm always consequent
on conscious guilt, operated so strongly upon
my mind, that it instantly struck me the old man
had been aware of my depredations, and had hurried
away to give an alarm, and cause my apprehension.
My fears were so great that I had not even power
to take down the third watch, but hastened out of
the shop, and on gaining the street, turned to my
right hand, (not daring to return to the inn,) and
putting the best foot foremost, I found myself in
a few minutes at the end of the town, and the
London road lying before me. However, as I
every moment expected to be pursued and overtaken,
I was afraid to continue in that road; but,
availing myself of the first turning I came to, which
was a narrow lane on my right, I quitted the turnpike
road, intending to take a circuitous course, in
order to avoid a pursuit.</p>

<p>It was now about five o’clock, and although I
much regretted the situation in which I had left
poor Bromley, who had no money about him, as I
was always purse-bearer, yet I conceived it would
be madness in me to return to Staines, convinced as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
I was of the danger to which I had exposed myself.
I therefore determined to proceed direct to town,
not doubting that Bromley would find means to
extricate himself, and speedily follow me. I was
for some time at a loss to find my way, but meeting
a countryman, he directed me; and after crossing a
number of fields, and scrambling over hedges and
ditches, I gained the high road once more, and
pushing forward, stopped at length to refresh myself
at a public-house about five miles from Staines.</p>

<p>It was by this time dusk, and, while I was baiting
at this house, one of the Bath stages luckily stopping
at the door, I applied to the coachman for a
passage, and ascending the vehicle, arrived safe at
Hyde-park corner, about nine o’clock the same
night.</p>

<p>The following day I was, of course, anxiously
solicitous about poor Bromley. I made inquiry
for him at every place he was accustomed to frequent,
but without success, during the whole morning.
At length, about four in the afternoon, as I
was walking through Leicester-fields, I unexpectedly
met him, to my great satisfaction. Mutual
inquiries immediately took place; and I was surprised
to hear him express the greatest astonishment
at my sudden departure from Staines, for which
he told me he was unable to account. This of
course produced an explanation, when it appeared
that nothing whatever had transpired respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
robbery I had committed, nor had Bromley seen or
heard any more of the old gentleman after the latter
quitted his company, which he did a few minutes
after myself. I must, therefore, have been mistaken
in my notion that he had observed my actions
through the watch-maker’s window, of which, at the
moment, I entertained no doubt; so true it is, that
a guilty conscience needs no accuser. What could
have occasioned his sudden retreat, is therefore
still a mystery to me.</p>

<p>Bromley then proceeded to inform me, that on
finding I did not return about my usual hour to tea,
he began to fear something unpleasant had happened,
and had accordingly taken a walk through the
town, in quest of me; but not succeeding in his object,
his astonishment and fears increased, and both
were heightened when bed-time approached without
my appearance. That being willing, however, to
hope for the best, he had supped by himself, and
telling the landlady, that he supposed his friend was
detained on business which prevented his return, he
had at length retired to bed. The following morning
he renewed his search, and meeting with no
better success, he took French leave of the landlady,
suffering her to retain our common bundle of necessaries,
which, indeed, were of more value than
our reckoning could amount to; and quitting Staines
about eight o’clock, the poor fellow had travelled
on foot to town, (a distance of sixteen miles,) having<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
accidentally one shilling in his pocket, which procured
him a breakfast, at the same public-house at
which I took the Bath stage.</p>

<p>Thus ended our projected expedition to Plymouth;
for having been so disappointed in the outset,
we had no inclination to make a second attempt.
I sold the two watches for five pounds, and dividing
that sum, as well as the residue of what I had acquired
by the “Letter racket,” with Bromley, we
turned our thoughts to other modes of obtaining
money.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to London, from Staines, I
was one day passing through Newgate-street, immediately
opposite the walls of Newgate, when
observing a grave-looking elderly gentleman, who
was walking just before me, to have a pocket-book
in his outside coat-pocket, I made an attempt to
ease him of it; but it being of an unusual size, and
rather ponderous, it slipped from my fingers, and
alarmed the gentleman; who, turning round sharply,
and seeing me close behind him, clapped his hand
upon my shoulder, saying very drily, “Holloa! young
man, when did you come to town?” I of course
affected to be much surprised, and with a look of
displeasure at his freedom, begged he would explain
his meaning. The stranger staring me full in the
face, and smiling sarcastically, pointed with his
finger to the opposite walls; and, in a low voice,
said, “You see that stone building, my pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
youth; mark my words, that will be your resting-place
very soon.”—Then, without suffering me to
reply, he crossed hastily towards Snow-hill, leaving
me to reflect at leisure upon his words, and wonder
at the strangeness of this adventure!</p>

<p>This gentleman, one would think, possessed the
gift of prophecy; for, as he had foretold, in less
than six weeks after, I actually became an inmate of
Newgate!</p>

<p>On Sunday the 17th of August, 1800, Bromley
and myself, after breakfasting together, agreed to walk
into the city; our business there, being to purchase
some base half-guineas and seven-shilling pieces,
of a Jew in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel. We accordingly
set out, and about one o’clock entered
Cheapside, when we observed a great concourse of
people, assembled round the door and windows of
a draper’s shop. As is natural to persons in
London, we entered the crowd out of curiosity; at
least that was my sole motive, for I always opposed
robbing on the Sabbath-day: (at which the reader
may perhaps smile.)—My partner Bromley, however,
had an eye to business, and I soon perceived
by his motions, that he was scrutinizing the pockets
of the spectators. I was, however, at some distance
from him, and signified my dissent by a look;
in fact, I had no sooner ascertained the object of
the people’s curiosity, which was an attempt made
in the preceding night, to break the shop open, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
which the shutters bore evident marks, than I
beckoned to Bromley, and made the best of my
way out of the crowd. I had no doubt but he would
immediately follow me, and having got clear of the
mob, and proceeded slowly about thirty yards from
the spot, on my way towards Whitechapel, I made
a stand, and turned round to see if Bromley was
coming. The reader, (<i>unless he doubts my veracity</i>)
will judge of my surprise, when I saw my poor companion,
struggling with a man who held him at
arm’s length with one hand, and had in the other a
silk handkerchief; at the same time calling after a
person who had also left the crowd, and was proceeding
the contrary way, (towards Saint Paul’s,)
“Stop Sir, come back, you’re robb’d.” The person
called to, immediately turned back, and at the same
moment, the fellow who held Bromley, seeing me
looking earnestly at the transaction, exclaimed
pointing at me, “Stop him in the blue coat! that’s
the other.” Knowing my innocence, I did not attempt
to escape; and a man now advancing to the
spot where I stood, seized me by the collar, and
dragged me back to the crowd. The person said
to be robbed, had by this time returned, and being
desired to search if he had lost any thing, did so,
and missed his handkerchief. The man who had
apprehended Bromley, proved to be a turnkey at
the Poultry-Compter, and a city constable; the
other, who seized me, was brother to the former,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and also a peace officer, their name, Alderman.
These two having now taken the address of the
stranger, who identified the handkerchief, and having
desired him to attend the next day at the Mansion-House,
they proceeded to escort Bromley and
myself to the Compter. On arriving at this prison,
they immediately searched us, and took from each
of us a silk handkerchief, a pocket-book, and other
articles, all our own property; but unluckily Bromley
had a second handkerchief about him, (I believe
a white muslin one,) which he had worn round his
neck the preceding day.—Being now locked up by
ourselves, we had leisure to talk over this unfortunate
affair, and I could not help censuring Bromley
for the imprudent act he had committed, especially
where the object was so insignificant. Indeed, I
had frequently, since our connexion, had occasion
to blame him for taking so petty an article as a
handkerchief, which, notwithstanding, he persisted
in doing, particularly if it was of a fancy pattern.
However, as there was no recalling the event, it
was agreed that he should make the best defence he
could for himself, and deny any knowledge of me,
which, as I was not near him, when he was detected,
I conceived would effectually procure my liberation.
Thus, after committing numerous acts of
robbery with impunity, I was at last apprehended
for what I had no more actual concern in, than the
reader of the page I am now writing.</p>

<p>The next day, Monday, we were taken to the
Mansion-House for examination, before the Lord
Mayor. The owner of the handkerchief being in
attendance, one of the officers acquainted his lordship,
that observing both Bromley and myself to
be very busy in the crowd assembled in Cheapside,
the preceding day, and suspecting our designs, he
had watched us narrowly, and at length observed
Bromley to take a handkerchief from a gentleman’s
pocket, which he immediately endeavoured to convey
to me; but before he could do so, he, the
witness, laid hold of him, and took the handkerchief
from his hand; on which (he stated) I endeavoured
to escape, but that he pointed me out to his brother,
who happened to be with him, and desired him to
secure me, while he himself called back the gentleman
who had been robbed, and informed him of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
the circumstance. (So much for the veracity of
this deponent’s evidence, to which he afterwards
deliberately swore!)</p>

<p>His brother corroborated the foregoing account,
which he was well enabled to do, having heard
the whole of it; and with this addition, that in the
course of his duty as a city constable, he had seen
us daily perambulating the streets, during the busy
hours, and knew us both to be notorious pickpockets.
(This was more wickedly false than all
the rest, for we had never given one of the city
officers the least opportunity to suspect or notice
us, but it had the effect they intended; that of
inducing the magistrate and prosecutor to deal
more rigidly with us.) They further swore, that
on searching us, they found two pocket-books,
several handkerchiefs, and other suspicious articles,
(meaning by these last, I suppose a small knife, and
a pair of scissors, which we each carried about us,)
all which they doubted not to be stolen!</p>

<p>Mr. Dowell, the person they had invited to prosecute
us, now deposed that he was a tradesman
living in Chancery-lane; that he knew nothing of
the robbery, but being called back by the first
witness, he missed his pocket-handkerchief, and that
the one produced by the officer, he believed to be
his, as it was of the same pattern, but had no mark
by which he could identify it. His lordship then
calling upon us for our defence, Bromley declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
that he had picked the handkerchief up in the
crowd, and at the same moment the officer seized
him, and charged him with stealing it; that he was
going on his own business at the time of this
affair happening, and that so far from my being
in his company, he never saw me before in his
life.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor appearing to have some pity
on our youth, asked Mr. Dowell if he was determined
to prosecute us, hinting at the same time,
that he, (his Lordship) did not wish to urge him to
that measure, provided we were willing to enter into
His Majesty’s service, but that he was at liberty to
act as he thought fit. I was in great hopes that
Mr. Dowell would incline to lenity, but the officers
took him on one side, and found means to persuade
him that he ought, for the sake of the public, to let
the law take its course. He was thereupon bound
over to prosecute, and we were committed to take
our trial at the next Old Bailey Sessions, commencing
the 17th of September. For the present, we were
remanded to the Poultry Compter; there to remain
until moving day, that is, the Thursday before
sessions.</p>

<p>As I conceived myself in some danger from the
inveterate malice of the two brothers, I deemed
it advisable to take all possible measures for my
deliverance; and it occurred to me, that as I
knew no person in London whom I could depend<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
on as a real friend, I should do well to inform my
father of my situation, and request the aid of his
experience, and personal mediation, in my behalf.—It
was now upwards of five years since I had
any intercourse with my parents, further than twice
or thrice calling at their residence, with a formal
inquiry after their health, and sometimes a cold
salutation when my father and I met in the streets:
at which times I always avoided any explanation as
to my circumstances, or the mode of life I led; and
since my quitting the navy, I had never exchanged a
word with them. I now therefore wrote to my
father, acquainting him with my distress, and
begging to see him without delay. He very soon
complied with my request, and I informed him,
(with as much adherence to truth as I thought
necessary,) of the cause of my confinement. My
father, who I have before mentioned to have been
unfortunate in his speculations, had been for several
years declining in the world, and notwithstanding his
want of affection towards me, I felt much concern
at his decayed appearance. He promised me every
assistance he could render by his personal exertions,
but declared his inability to extend pecuniary aid,
the times being at this crisis peculiarly hard, and
every necessary of life daily advancing in price. Fortunately
I had some good clothes, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and a few
pounds in money by me; and my father, being
directed by me, repaired to my lodgings, and secured<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
all my effects, which he removed to his own house,
supplying me occasionally with such articles or
money, as I found myself in need of. My father,
at this period, resided in St. George’s Fields, where
he had taken and furnished a small house, the major
part of which he let out in lodgings. By this expedient,
and I believe (under the rose,) a little dabbling
in the lottery, he made a shift to keep the
wolf (or rather the bailiff) from the door. My
mother also visited me in the Compter, accompanied
by my two sisters, and shewed me every attention
in her power.</p>

<p>Being removed on the usual day to Newgate, I
applied myself to draw up a brief, for the purpose
of employing a counsel in behalf of my unfortunate
companion, who had not himself the means of
obtaining legal assistance. As to myself, I conceived
nothing but the grossest perjury could induce
a jury to convict me, under the circumstances of my
apprehension; knowing as I do, that in no court in
Europe, has a prisoner so much justice shewn him,
or such lenity in a doubtful case, as at the Old
Bailey: besides, my father believing my protestations
of innocence, (I mean of all connexion with
Bromley,) would not for a moment entertain a
doubt of my acquittal, and therefore opposed the
unnecessary expense of feeing counsel. Having
completed the brief to my satisfaction, I sent it<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
(unknown to my father) with the usual fee, to Mr.
Alley.</p>

<p>Every thing being thus arranged, and a true bill
returned by the grand jury upon the evidence of the
officers to the same effect as before, I was on the
23d of September put to the bar, together with
Bromley; and, as I have so frequently read the
printed report of our trial, that it will never be
erased from my memory, I shall give the reader the
substance of the proceedings, which I can do nearly
verbatim: and, I believe upon the whole, a more
extraordinary trial has been seldom found upon
record.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TRIAL, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Alexander Bromley and James Vaux, were indicted
for feloniously stealing on the 17th of August,
a handkerchief, value two shillings, the goods
of William Dowell, privily from his person.</p>

<p>To this indictment the prisoners pleaded “Not
guilty.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alley, counsel for Bromley, desired that the
witnesses might be examined apart, with which
request the court complied.</p>

<p>William Alderman sworn.—“I am a city constable,
and turnkey of the Poultry Compter. On
Sunday the 17th of August, I was passing through
Cheapside, when observing a crowd of persons collected
together, I went up to inquire the cause; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
there saw the two prisoners, and knowing them to
be suspicious characters, I watched their motions,
and presently saw Bromley take a handkerchief
from the pocket of the prosecutor, which he attempted
to give to Vaux, but before Vaux could
take it from him, I seized Bromley with the handkerchief
in his hand.” (Here witness went on to
describe our apprehension, in the same terms as he
had done before the Lord Mayor). “I can produce
the handkerchief; I have had it ever since.—On
searching the prisoners, we found upon them two
pocket-books, and several handkerchiefs, with other
suspicious articles; but the Lord Mayor ordered
them to be returned, when he committed the prisoners
for trial.”</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.—<i>Q.</i> Which of
the prisoners took the handkerchief?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> They both had hold of it: the biggest, Vaux,
let go immediately.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you mean to swear they both took it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Which pocket was it taken from?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The left-hand coat-pocket.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You know there is a reward, if these two
poor boys are convicted. Was it you that advised
the prosecutor to lay this indictment capital?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The grand jury found the bill. (<i>Witness
ordered to withdraw.</i>)</p>

<p>Thomas Alderman sworn.—“I was with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
brother. I saw both the prisoners very busy,
lifting up the lids of people’s pockets. Bromley
took a gentleman’s handkerchief, on which my
brother seized him. I apprehended Vaux. He
had got away to some distance from the crowd.”</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.—<i>Q.</i> What are
you, Sir?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I am a tailor, and a constable of the city.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> So you thought you could get more by prosecuting
these two poor young lads, than by sitting
on your shop-board at work?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I did my duty.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Who took the handkerchief?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Bromley took it out, and Vaux laid hold of
the corner, to take it from Bromley.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Which pocket was it in, the right or the left?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The right-hand pocket<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Now, Sir, you know these poor lads are
trying for an offence, for which they are liable to be
hanged, if they are convicted: I ask you, upon the
oath you have taken, whether you ever heard of
two persons putting their hands in a man’s pocket
at once?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I never did.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then if your brother has said so, he has told
a lie?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That he certainly has. (<i>A general laugh in
the court.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>[<i>The handkerchief produced and identified by
the prosecutor, from its similitude to the one
he lost.</i>]</p>

<p>Bromley called four witnesses, and Vaux two
witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

<p>Bromley’s defence.—“I picked the handkerchief
up in the crowd.”</p>

<p>Vaux’s defence.—“I am innocent.”</p>

<p class="center">Bromley, <i>Guilty</i> (aged 20,)<br>
Vaux, <i>Guilty</i> (aged 18,)</p>

<p class="center"><i>Of stealing the handkerchief value eleven pence</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus ended this curious trial, to the general dissatisfaction
of a crowded audience, who expressed
their sentiments by loud and distinct murmurs.
The jury returned the above verdict, in order to
reduce the offence to a simple felony, by finding the
value of the property under one shilling, stealing from
the person to which amount is death. My father,
together with Mr. Kirby, the keeper of Newgate,
stood at my elbow during the whole trial, and
both advised me to make the laconic defence I
did. It was their firm belief, that I should be
acquitted, and the result surprised them much.
The witnesses to Bromley’s character were tailors,
with whom he had formerly worked; those in my
favour, were very respectable tradesmen, adduced by
my father. On leaving the bar, the latter, as well
as Mr. Kirby, comforted me with the assurance,
that the court would only impose a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
fine<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> upon us; and my father promised to use all
his interest, and that of his friends with the Recorder,
previous to the latter passing sentence, for
which end Mr. Kirby advised a petition to be immediately
prepared. This task I accomplished the
next day, and delivered it to my father for presentation.</p>

<p>Both Bromley and myself (buoyed up by the
assurances above-mentioned,) entertained the fullest
hopes that our sentence would be lenient. On the
last day of the session, according to custom, all
the prisoners convicted, were brought into court, to
receive judgment. Those capitally convicted were
first put to the bar, and received the awful sentence
of death; after which a few were ordered to be
transported for fourteen years; and then forty
persons were called in succession, (among whom
were myself and Bromley,) and being placed at the
bar, the whole forty were collectively sentenced
to seven years transportation, beyond the high
seas! This severe doom affected us both in a
very great degree. I, for my part, was inconsolable,
and shed tears in abundance. My father, on visiting
me the next day, professed much concern, and
would have still flattered me with hopes of a reverse;
but I have since had good reason to believe, that
instead of using his influence in my favour, he secretly<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
approved of the event, conceiving, I suppose,
that sending me out of the country, might save me
from a still worse fate; and, that this was therefore,
(to use the common phrase of parents on
such occasions,) the best thing that could have
happened for me.</p>

<p>After the first effects of our grief had subsided,
the society of our fellow-prisoners, and the bustle
constantly prevailing in the prison, soon banished
every trace of sorrow, and we became as cheerful
as the best. My father and mother paid me every
attention, and the produce of my own effects was
fully adequate to my support for several months:
when that resource failed, my father contributed his
mite; and with the help of another friend or two, I
was comparatively comfortable during my continuance
in Newgate. As for Bromley, his father,
on hearing his sad fate, had allotted him a weekly
pittance, sufficient, with care, to keep him above
want.</p>

<p>About a month after the close of the session, the
gaol being unusually crowded with prisoners, a most
dreadful contagion, called the gaol fever, made its
appearance, and spread so universally, throughout
every ward and division of the prison, that very few
escaped its attack. I was one of the first to contract
it, and was immediately carried to the infirmary,
or sick-ward of the prison, where I only
remember having my irons taken off, and being put<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to bed; for the same night, I became delirious, and
was so dreadfully affected, as to continue insensible
for three weeks, during which time, I had no knowledge
of my parents, or of any other person who
approached me; and the fever raged to such a
degree, that I was obliged to be bound in my bed,
in order to restrain me from acts of mischief. My
poor companion, Bromley, was attacked about the
same time as myself; and, on recovering my reason,
I found him laid in the adjacent bed to my own,
and was informed his sufferings had been equally
grievous with mine. It pleased God, however, to
restore us both to perfect health; but numerous
were the unhappy persons who fell victims to this
dire disease.</p>

<p>It is usual to make occasional draughts of convicts
under sentence of transportation, from Newgate
to the Hulks at Woolwich, Portsmouth, <i>&amp;c.</i>,
on board of which receptacles they continue until
a ship is in readiness, to convey them to New
South Wales. Few prisoners are suffered to remain
above three months in the prison, after their conviction.
A longer continuance is effected either by
bribery or interest. My father, having heard a
shocking account of the Hulks, had waited on Mr.
Kirby, the gaoler, soon after my receiving sentence,
and obtained a promise that I should remain
in Newgate, until a ship was on the point
of sailing for this colony; and herein, he was as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
good as his word.—My father, at length received
a private intimation from Mr. Kirby, that he had no
time to lose in arranging matters for my departure:
accordingly, with the assistance of two or
three other friends, my father contrived to pack up
a few of the most necessary comforts for my use on
the passage, which he afterwards sent to Portsmouth
by the coach. On the 15th of May, 1801,
my father, mother, and sisters, came to take a final
leave of me; there was something solemn in this
scene, which affected me much, though our mutual
regard was not of the most violent nature. I also
took leave of my companion in adversity, who, by
what means I know not, still remained in Newgate,
but was shortly after my departure, removed to the
hulks at Portsmouth.—The next morning (May
16th,) at four o’clock, myself, and thirteen others,
who had been all kept back for this opportunity,
were attached together by a strong chain, and
escorted by the keeper and his subordinates to
Blackfriars-bridge, where a lighter was in readiness
to receive us, in which we proceeded down the river
Thames to Gravesend, and about noon arrived
alongside the Minorca transport, Captain Leith,
bound for Port-Jackson, in company with the Canada
and Nile, which ships were also lying at this
anchorage, for the purpose of receiving their prisoners
on board.</p>

</div>

<p>Having entered the ship, we were all indiscriminately
stripped, (according to indispensable
custom) and were saluted with several buckets of
salt-water, thrown over our heads by a boatswain’s-mate.
After undergoing this watery ordeal, we
were compelled to put on a suit of slop-clothing.
Our own apparel, though good in kind, being
thrown overboard. We were then double-ironed,
and put between-decks, where we selected such
births, for sleeping, <i>&amp;c.</i>, as each thought most eligible.
The next day, we received on board forty-six
more prisoners, from the Hulks at Woolwich,
and the Canada fifty. The Nile also took on board
one hundred women, from the different gaols in
Great Britain. The three ships then sailed for
Spithead, where, on our arrival, the Minorca and
Canada had their numbers augmented, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Hulks at Portsmouth, to one hundred men each.
Every thing being now in readiness, we only waited
for the convoy to assemble, with which we were to
proceed to a certain latitude.</p>

<p>During this interval, I wrote the first intimation
of my unhappy state, to my dear and honoured
grandfather, palliating the facts as much as possible,
and positively denying any criminal connexion between
myself and Bromley. This I did, in order
to save those heart-rending pangs, which I knew
my venerable and virtuous benefactors would suffer,
if they had been acquainted with the dissolute
life I had for some time led. In a few days, I received
a long and most affectionate letter from my
grandfather, in which he deplored the harshness of
my destiny; but far from aggravating my sufferings
by reflections on my manifold indiscretions, this
good old man laboured only to press my resignation
to the dispensations of Providence, and to exhort
me, by my future conduct, to make atonement
for the past. He added a great deal of good advice,
as to my behaviour in the degraded state to which
I was reduced, concluding with his blessing, and
that of my grandmother, and a most pathetic and
tender farewell.—I had assured my grandfather in
my letter, that no extension of pecuniary aid could
at all ameliorate my situation, as I had a sufficient
store of necessary comforts for my voyage: my motive
for this assurance, was, to prevent him from<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
distressing himself still further in his old age on an
object so worthless as myself, by whose expensive
adoption and education, he and the partner of his
griefs were already reduced to a state bordering on
indigence, aggravated by mental anxiety and sorrow
for me, the unworthy cause.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June, we sailed from Spithead,
in company with about three hundred sail of merchantmen,
bound to various ports, under convoy
of a frigate and a sloop of war. The convoy
parted from us soon after we passed the Canary
Islands, and our three ships proceeded in company.
A few days after we put to sea, I was noticed by
Captain Leith, to whom I had (as my grandfather
advised me) offered the services of my pen, <i>&amp;c.</i>
The captain, in consequence, employed me during
the voyage in writing his Log, Journal, and other
accompts, and extended to me all the indulgence
my situation would admit of. The latter end of
August we arrived at Rio de Janeiro, where we
had every refreshment the place afforded, and, after
a continuance of thirty days, we resumed our voyage.
Nothing worthy of notice occurred therein; our
little squadron kept company until we made the
Harbour of Port Jackson, which we did on the 14th
of December, and the same day came to an anchor
in Sydney-cove.</p>

<p>Among my fellow-prisoners, was a young man
named Calvert, with whom I had become very intimate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
In the course of our passage, this person
had shewn me an open letter of recommendation to
John Palmer, Esq., then Commissary of New South
Wales, which was from a particular friend of the
latter gentleman, and pleaded strongly in favour of
the bearer. A few days before our arrival, it occurred
to me, that a humble application in my own
behalf to Mr. Palmer might have the effect of obtaining
for me some little distinction, as I heard a
most amiable character of him, and conceived my
services might not be unacceptable in his public
department. I therefore wrote a respectful letter,
which I consigned to the care of Captain Leith, who
promised not only to deliver it himself, but to speak
in my favour, both to Mr. Palmer and his Excellency
the governor.</p>

<p>The second day after our arrival, several gentlemen
came on board, to muster and inspect the prisoners:
among the number was Mr. Palmer himself,
who, having received my letter, was pleased to tell
me, in the kindest manner, that he had mentioned
me to the Governor, and that I might accordingly
expect a favourable appointment on my landing.
The majority of the prisoners were sent up the
country, the day after the muster, to various kinds
of labour, but myself and a few others, were
detained on board until the 19th, on which day
we landed at Sydney, and were immediately
conducted to Government-House, in order to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
severally examined and disposed of by Governor
King. We were called in succession for our
audience; and, when it came to my turn, I entered
the room with a respectful bow to the gentlemen
assembled; for there were seated at a table, several
officers of the colony, besides his Excellency. The
latter, however, I soon distinguished by his manner
of addressing me, and as the particulars of this interview
may afford some entertainment to those
who were not acquainted with the eccentric character
of Governor King, I shall give the reader our
conversation in dialogue, as near as my memory will
permit.</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Regarding me from head to foot, with
a most inquisitive eye, or rather four eyes, for he
wore spectacles, and, with a manner, the very reverse
to encouraging) “Well, Mr. Vaux, what
were you sent here for?”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> (Of course a little embarrassed at this unexpected
question, so abruptly put,) “Sir, I had
the misfortune to be acquainted with a person of
bad character, who in my company committed”⸺</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Interrupting me impatiently) “But
Mr. Vaux, come to the point at once. I don’t want
you to come round here, and then back again, and
round the other way, (drawing circles on the table
with his finger, and all the while staring at me,
which indeed he continued to do as long as I remained
in the room, as if determined to put me out<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
of countenance); recollect, Mr. Vaux, you are not
at the bar of the Old Bailey now. Come to the
point, Sir, come to the point. I ask you what you
were sent here for?”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “Sir, I was charged with picking a gentleman’s
pocket, but, though your Excellency may
doubt my assertion, I solemnly assure you, I was
innocent of that fact.”</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (with a most satirical smile, and throwing
himself back in his chair) “O, I dare say, Mr.
Vaux, very innocent no doubt. Quite innocent, I
dare say. So the long and the short of it is, you
were sent here for picking pockets.”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “I confess, Sir, that was the charge.”</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> “What have you been brought up to,
Mr. Vaux?”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “Sir, I have been chiefly employed in the
law; but I profess to be a clerk in general.”</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> “Pray, Sir, what office were you in
last?”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “Sir, the last gentleman I served was
Mr. Preston, in King’s Bench Walk.”</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (With a frown) “That I very much
doubt, Sir; that I very much doubt, Sir; that I
very much doubt, Mr. Vaux.”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “I am sorry your Excellency has so bad
an opinion of me; I assure you, Sir, it is the
fact.”</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> “Well, Mr. Vaux, I shall send you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
a place, where your roguery will very soon be found
out.”</p>

<p><i>Vaux.</i> “I hope not, your Excellency; I trust
you will have”⸺</p>

<p><i>Governor.</i> (Interrupting) “Well, I hope so too, Mr.
Vaux; I hope so too, I hope so too, Sir; but mind—I
only give you a caution; take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>Then hastily scribbling a few words on a scrap of
paper, he handed it to me, and ordering a light-horseman
to attend me, made a motion for me to
withdraw, which I was glad enough to do, in order
to be relieved from this embarrassing examination.—On
going out, the horseman informed me he had
orders to see myself and baggage on board the Parramatta
passage-boat; the paper I had received
proved to be an order to the boatman to that effect,
and on the reverse was a memorandum, purporting
that I was appointed clerk to Mr. Baker, Store-keeper
at Hawkesbury. Both these documents
were signed P. G. K., as was his usual custom; but
the whole so unintelligibly written, that it cost me
much pains and some inquiry to decipher them.—I
now took up my little box, and my bed, and was
conducted to the wharf, where I found the boat on
the point of departure. After a pleasant passage,
we arrived at Parramatta, at which place I rested
the ensuing day, and, on Monday the 21st, continued
my journey by land to Hawkesbury, a distance of
twenty-six miles. On this occasion I joined a party<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
of travellers, accompanied by a cart in which I had
deposited my luggage; these persons formed a sort
of caravan, and were all well-armed, the natives
being at this time in a state of warfare, and the roads
thereby rendered dangerous. Late in the evening
we arrived at Hawkesbury, and being directed to
Mr. Baker’s house, I immediately presented myself
and my credentials to that gentleman.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Baker received me with kindness, and
great pleasure, as, my predecessor having quitted
him some weeks before, he was at a loss for a proper
assistant. In a few days I had a comfortable
residence assigned me by the commanding officer
of the settlement, and my duty being exempted
from all hard labour, and of such a nature as I found
pleasure in performing, I soon felt myself comparatively
happy.—With retrospective satisfaction, I can
truly say, that I behaved in this situation with so
much propriety as to obtain the favour of my principal,
and the good opinion of the resident magistrate,
Dr. Arndell, whose four children I attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
at my leisure hours, in the quality of preceptor.
Both this gentleman and Mr. Baker vied with each
other, in shewing me every mark of kindness in their
power.—Mr. Baker informed me that Governor
King made frequent and particular inquiries of him
respecting my conduct, and I felt the highest gratification
from the reflection that I had happily falsified
his Excellency’s uncharitable prediction as to
my real character. Mr. Palmer also, who had been
the first kind promoter of my good fortune, made
similar inquiries of Mr. Baker, and from the report
he received of my talents, expressed a desire to
transfer me from Hawkesbury to the Commissary’s
Office at Sydney, in which department there was
then a great press of business, and expert clerks were
not, at that period, so numerous as at present. Mr.
Baker, however, being unwilling to part with me,
paid no attention to the wish of Mr. Palmer, until
the latter gentleman at length ordered in direct
terms, by an official letter, that I should be immediately
sent to Sydney. The Governor coming up to
Hawkesbury a day or two afterwards, Mr. Baker
represented to his Excellency, the inconvenience
he should suffer, if he was deprived of my assistance,
and obtained an order from him to retain me in his
service. This arrangement was not at all satisfactory
to me, for I had long felt an earnest desire to be
employed in the commissariat, as the public accompts
therein kept, were of such a description as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
I always took delight in, and I still flatter myself
that from my quickness in figures, I should be perfectly
at home in such a situation. However I was
not to be gratified on that occasion, and I continued
in the service of Mr. Baker about three years.
I had, in fact, reconciled myself to the idea of serving
out my full term of banishment with this worthy
man; but on a sudden, a letter was received by
Mr. Arndell from Governor King, ordering my instant
removal to Sydney, for the purpose of assisting
as a clerk in the Secretary’s Office, which, as it
was then established might be, and was generally,
called the Governor’s Office, being attached to
Government House, and under the immediate personal
direction of the Governor himself. Though
this preferment seemed to hold out a prospect of
future advantage, and to confer increased respectability,
it was with some regret I quitted my comfortable
little house and garden at “The Green
Hills<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,” where I had led a life of innocence and
peaceful retirement; whereas I was now about to enter
a vortex of dissipation, folly and wickedness, for such
was Sydney compared to my late place of abode.</p>

<p>The Governor received me very graciously, allotted
me a neat brick-house in the vicinity of the
office, and a government-man, victualled from the
King’s-stores, as a servant. For two or three months<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
I continued very steady, and formed but few acquaintances.
The Governor behaved to me with
great liberality, and refused me no reasonable
request. By degrees, however, I began to degenerate.
I increased my acquaintance among the
Commissary’s and some other clerks, most of whom
lived an expensive and dissipated life. All I can
say in my own favour, is that I continued to be regular
in my attendance at the office, and was never
found defective, or incapable of my duty; but no
sooner was I at my own disposal than I eagerly
sought my dissipated companions, and spent the
rest of the day in drinking, and other irregularities,
sometimes at public or disorderly houses, and frequently
at my own, where I had often the expensive
pleasure of entertaining a large party of my fellow-scribes
at my own cost. This course of life unavoidably
drew me into great expenses, and I contracted
several debts. Governor King, whose vigilant observation
nothing of this sort could escape, gave me
frequent and serious admonitions for my good; but
I was so infatuated as to disregard all advice, and
only thought of devising pecuniary means to continue
my licentious career. This was no easy task,
as the nature of business in the Secretary’s Office
afforded few opportunities of realizing money by
fraud, at least without the assistance of one or more
confederates in a neighbouring department. The
expensive rate at which the Commissary’s clerks<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
constantly lived, had become matter of surprise to
the Governor as well as the magistrates, and was
the theme of much conjecture among the inhabitants
of Sydney. Still, though it was palpable they had
recourse to fraud, they managed matters so adroitly
that no irregularity could be detected; and the efforts
of the executive authority, to develope their
system, continued unavailing.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Governor King, as I have
before observed, to use only his initials as a signature
on common occasions, and by application and
practice I acquired a knack of imitating this sign-manual
with sufficient accuracy to impose upon the
parties to whom the superscription was addressed.
Finding these three letters to have the magical effect
of procuring for me whatever articles I required,
from the King’s-stores, I availed myself of
their talismanic power, and converting the goods
so obtained into money, I discharged my debts,
and figured away with increased <i>eclat</i>, among my
fellow-clerks. As it was, however, both impolitic
and dangerous to carry this branch of fraud too far,
or practice it too frequently, I at length found
means to form a connexion with two or three of my
most experienced friends, and we concerted such a
system of ways and means as promised liberally to
supply our wants, and, while we continued true
to each other, seemed to preclude a possibility of
detection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>As I do not conceive myself justified in exposing
either the parties who were my colleagues, or
the particular nature of our artifices, let it suffice
to inform the reader, that (as is indeed usually
and deservedly the fate of all sinister practices)
a mere and most unexpected accident, and for which
none of us could attach blame to ourselves, discovered
to the Governor a principal branch of that
prolific tree of fraud and imposition, from whose
productive fruitfulness we had so abundantly derived
the means of gratifying our folly and intemperance,
which we at that time miscalled a love of
pleasure; but (to continue the metaphor) the root
and body of this tree, still remained hidden from the
strict and rigid search set on foot by the Governor,
and after this transitory alarm had subsided, proved
to its remaining adherents, a source of supply for a
considerable time. It so happened that I was the
ostensible party in the particular affair which led
to this discovery; and Governor King immediately
took the most active measures to effect a full developement
of that system which he well knew to be
the ground-work of mal-practices to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>With this view I underwent several private examinations
before his Excellency and some of the
principal officers, and great promises were held out
to extract information from me, but without effect,
as I was determined not to betray my friends, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
ruin could not at all palliate my guilt, or, as I conceived,
render me a whit more deserving of mercy.
I therefore persisted in asserting my innocence of
the present charge, and disclaimed all knowledge
of fraud in any other person.</p>

<p>The Governor was so much exasperated at my
obstinacy, that he at length had recourse (as a <i>dernier
resort</i>,) to the expedient of flogging to extort
confession. I must, however, (for justice sake,)
acknowledge that such cruelty was rarely exercised
by Governor King, who in his cooler moments
was a most humane character. To the honour of
our present governor (Macquarrie,) be it recorded,
that not only this inhuman practice is exploded, but
corporal punishment is seldom inflicted at all, and
when rendered necessary, it is used with moderation.</p>

<p>To resume, the Governor finding me firm in my
resolution to give him no satisfaction, ordered Dr.
Harris, who was present, to take me to the jail-yard,
send for the public executioner, and there to
give me five-and-twenties, (this was his phrase,) till
I confessed the whole truth. Pursuant to this order
I accompanied Mr. Harris to the appointed spot,
and while the finisher of the law was arranging
matters for the approaching ceremony, the Doctor
used all his art of persuasion to induce me for my
own sake, to avoid the disgrace and pain of a correction,
which he must, if I continued obstinate, inflict
in its fullest extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>There was certainly much justice in this gentleman’s
arguments, and, although I am confident I
could have summoned up resolution to have continued
silent under the threatened chastisement, yet,
on mature reflection, I was convinced of the folly
of such a conduct, as there was already sufficient
and incontrovertible proof of guilt against me. I,
therefore, determined to acknowledge my errors,
and submit my fate to the Governor’s pleasure. Of
this intention I acquainted Mr. Harris, who immediately
stayed the proceedings about to take place,
and supplying me with pen and paper, desired me
to write my declaration, which he would himself
convey to the Governor. In the letter I hastily composed,
I informed his Excellency, that feelings of
remorse and regret for my ill conduct, rather than a
fear of punishment, had induced me to confess to
him that I was guilty of the charge brought against
me on the present occasion, and with shame I acknowledged
having repeatedly transgressed in a similar
manner, in order to defray the expenses of the
unbecoming course of life I had imprudently fallen
into. But I positively declared that no other person
whatever was privy to my numerous acts of
fraud, as those counterfeit documents framed by me,
had passed through the usual official channels as
genuine; and, consequently, the parties who had admitted
and sanctioned them, were utterly guiltless of
connivance, and had done no more than their duty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
I added, that I knew how justly I deserved to suffer
for my faults; but I also knew that mercy was the
predominant sentiment in His Excellency’s bosom,
and on that mercy I therefore most humbly threw
myself.</p>

<p>Doctor Harris immediately proceeded to Government-house
with my letter, and I was soon afterwards
summoned to follow in person. His Excellency
seemed not displeased at the course I had
adopted, and he was now in a very mild and
placid mood. After expatiating at some length,
and in a serio-comic strain, with his usual eccentricity,
on the ill return I had made for his favours,
and so forth, he was pleased to order me back to
the jail, but in a tone that indicated no severity of
intention. It gave me much concern, however,
that notwithstanding all I had before said, or could
now protest on the subject, the Governor ordered a
young man in a confidential situation under government,
to be dismissed from his office, under an impression
that he was privy to the fraud in question.
It is true indeed, this person, by the injudicious
defence he made, was the cause of his own misfortune,
and had very nearly, from his statement being
at variance with mine, contributed to ruin all my hopes
of belief. But the Governor, who though shrewd
at times, was not at all times a Solomon, thought
proper to credit my assertion, and reject the evidence
of the other party, as too improbable to be received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>The next morning early, an order came to the
prison from his Excellency, that I was to be double-ironed,
and put to the hardest labour, in common
with those incorrigible characters composing what
is called the jail-gang: I was in consequence set
to work at mending the public-roads, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>, and
as I had never before used a heavier tool than a
goose-quill, I found this penance to bear hard
upon me, and repented me of the evil which had
brought me to this woeful condition.</p>

</div>

<p>I continued to labour in double-irons,
(locked up every night in the jail,) for about a month,
when a draught of men being ordered to the public
agricultural settlement of Castle-hill, twenty-four
miles from Sydney, I was included in the number,
and about twenty of us were immediately sent up,
escorted by constables. Notwithstanding my condition
in the jail-gang was deplorable enough, I
felt a greater depression at the thoughts of going to
this settlement, a place of which, from every account,
I had conceived the most unfavourable idea.
Though I suffered much in Sydney, by being
obliged to work till three o’clock in so disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
a situation, yet when that hour released me
from the restraint of the overseer, I was enabled
to visit my friends and acquaintances, with whom
I enjoyed myself till sun-set, when I was obliged to
return to the jail, and was locked up for the night.
On the contrary, Castle-hill being considered a
place of punishment, the prisoners there, who were
sent up under circumstances like mine, were not
allowed to quit the settlement at all. On arriving
at Castle-hill, I was first employed at the hoe,
which severe labour was so fatiguing to me, that it
had nearly the effect of breaking my heart. However,
I contrived at times to obtain a lighter employment:
and during the term of my remaining at
this settlement, I had a spell at almost every kind of
work peculiar to the place.</p>

<p>After a few weeks had elapsed, I prevailed on
the superintendent (Mr. Knight,) who had conceived
a partiality for me, to grant me a pass to Parramatta,
eight miles distant, and sixteen from Sydney.
I had an anxious wish to visit the latter place, but Mr.
Knight had no power to extend his permission so
far, and I knew that application to the magistrates
at Parramatta would be fruitless. I, therefore, determined
to hazard a flogging, which would be the
consequence of my detection, and to take the wished-for
trip without leave or license. This being
Friday, and my week’s work done, I accordingly
set off, accompanied by two or three others, similarly<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
circumstanced, and after six hours’ walking arrived
at Sydney. Here I lay concealed in the house
of a friend till Sunday noon, when I again set out
proceeding with the utmost caution, and arrived at
Castle-hill the same night, conformable to the tenor
of my pass. As I experienced nothing but misery
and privation during five days in each week, and
found such enjoyments in Sydney, I repeated my
excursion almost every succeeding Friday, but was
not always equally fortunate in my proceedings.
The police in Sydney having some information of
my visits, were constantly on the look-out for me,
and I was at last apprehended, punished with fifty
lashes, and sent back in custody of a constable.
This did not deter me, however, from running the
same risk at several subsequent periods, only redoubling
my precautions, and travelling in the night.</p>

<p>I had been about ten months at Castle-hill, when
the person who had officiated as clerk of the camp,
(that is, clerk to the superintendent,) becoming a
free man, quitted the settlement, and I being the
only one qualified for such an office, and in some
favour with Mr. Knight, was promoted to the situation.
I now found myself perfectly at ease, and
the more so from having been so long kept at hard
labour, for which I was but ill adapted. My duty
consisted in measuring the daily portion of ground
to the different gangs who were breaking up, chipping,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, keeping a daily account of the various<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
works carried on, mustering the prisoners every
Monday morning, writing passes at the week’s end,
assisting in the issue of provisions from the store, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<i>&amp;c.</i>; and as these duties were all perfectly familiar
to me I acquitted myself with credit, and, by observing
a proper conduct, gained the good will of all
parties.</p>

<p>Governor King was frequently in the habit of
visiting the settlement, for the purpose of personally
inspecting the state of things, and as he had received
favourable accounts of my general conduct, he began
about this time to notice me in a manner that
shewed (I thought,) an inclination to restore me to
his wonted favour. But as I had now little more
than a year of my time unexpired, and was tolerably
comfortable in my new situation, I had so far reconciled
myself, that I was but little anxious about
a removal, until the hour of my freedom arrived.
However, it was destined otherwise, and I underwent
another very unexpected change of fortune.
In the beginning of August 1806, I was suddenly
summoned by a special messenger, to attend on the
Reverend Mr. Marsden, the chief magistrate of
Parramatta. I immediately obeyed this summons,
of the cause of which I could form no conjecture.
On my arrival at the court-house, Mr. Marsden informed
me, that he had sent for me to assist him in
taking a muster of the inhabitants of Parramatta,
and the surrounding districts, which was to commence<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
that very day, and to form part of a general
muster throughout the colony, at this period in progress.
I felt myself a little flattered by this distinction,
as Mr. Marsden had already a clerk, but it seems
he was not sufficiently quick, and it was known that I
had before frequently officiated on similar occasions.
I assured Mr. Marsden that I would with pleasure
undertake the task, and at the appointed hour we proceeded
to business. The muster occupied two
whole days, and, being ended, Mr. Marsden told
me that his clerk, having received a free pardon
from Governor King, was about to quit the colony
in a few days, and that it was his intention to appoint
me his successor, promising, if I behaved well,
to shew me every indulgence in his power. He
then desired I would go back to Castle-hill, for the
purpose of arranging my affairs, and return as soon
as possible to Parramatta. I lost no time in obeying
these orders, and the following day again presented
myself to Mr. Marsden. I was immediately
put in possession of the court-house, a comfortable
brick building, surrounded by a good garden, which
was to be my place of residence. I was allowed a
government servant, and also an old man as housekeeper:
the latter being equal to any little services
I wanted, I was enabled to permit the former to
work for his own living, allowing me a weekly sum
for the indulgence, according to the custom of the
colony, and as he had hitherto done to my predecessor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
In addition to this privilege, I was allowed
various fees in the course of my public
duties, agreeably to a code or table sanctioned by
the magistrates, so that upon the whole my income
was sufficient to support me in a manner becoming
the respectability of my appointment. Mr. Marsden
and his colleague in the commission, Captain
Abbot, were accustomed to preside as a bench of
magistrates every Saturday, and sometimes alternately
on other days in each week. On these occasions
it was my duty to take depositions, write
out warrants, commitments, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> I had besides
to keep a general account of all public work in
Parramatta, compiled from the reports of the different
overseers, <i>&amp;c.</i> In this situation, my knowledge
of the law, and my acquaintance with Burn’s
Justice proved of the utmost advantage, as there were
many cases constantly occurring, in which certain
formalities (dispensed with before my appointment,)
gave an official aspect to the proceedings of the
court, and added a solemnity productive of the best
effects. Upon the whole I found myself very comfortably
situated, and I had the pleasure to observe
that my exertions to acquit myself in the most becoming
manner, procured me the consideration such
a conduct merited, from the gentlemen under whom
I acted.</p>

<p>In the month of October following my removal
to Parramatta, the departure of Governor King for<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
England, in His Majesty’s Ship Buffalo, was
publicly announced to take place in the ensuing month,
his Excellency’s successor, Governor Bligh, having
arrived in the preceding August, on the 13th of
which month the latter assumed the supreme command.
Since the period of his supersession, Governor
King had principally resided at Parramatta,
and I was frequently employed by him in arranging
his private accounts, transcribing directions to his
agents respecting his farms, live-stock, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and
various other matters. On these occasions he treated
me with the greatest politeness, and appeared
to have quite forgot my former delinquencies. One
day Mr. Marsden questioned me as to the length of
time I had to serve, and on my answering eleven
months, he distantly hinted that if he could depend
on my future good conduct, he was not without
hopes of prevailing on Governor King to procure a
remission of my remaining term, and allow me a
passage to England in his own ship; adding, that
himself and family were about proceeding to Europe
by the same opportunity. This being an event of
which I had never entertained the slightest hope,
my joyful emotions at the bare idea, could only be
equalled by my surprise at such an intimation. It
immediately struck me that the latter was the result
of preconcertion between Governor King and Mr.
Marsden, and that it was at the bottom, his Excellency’s
wish to render me this essential service.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
The sequel proved that my conjectures were not
unfounded, for it afterwards appeared that Governor
King having an incredible number of public documents
lying in a state of great confusion, and most of
which he wanted copied prior to delivering them
up, it was indispensably necessary that he should
have an expeditious and experienced clerk, to
transcribe and arrange such papers, during his
voyage home; and it seems he knew of no person
more eligible for such an employment than myself.
I replied to Mr. Marsden, with a warmth and
earnestness which convinced him how happy such
an arrangement would make me, and assured him
of my everlasting gratitude towards himself and the
late Governor for their consideration; earnestly pressing
Mr. Marsden to a speedy “consummation” of
what I so “devoutly wished.” The anxiety of
mind produced in me by this conversation may be
conceived by the reader, if he reflects upon the
situation in which I was then placed; for, though it
was my chief and ardent wish to return to my native
land as soon as I became free, yet as I had no apparent
prospect of realizing money enough to pay
my passage, and the hardships incidental to working
for it, would expose me to the most trying severities,
such an opportunity as the one I now contemplated,
could not be too highly appreciated, or too eagerly
embraced.</p>

<p><i>The Buffalo being ready for Sea, I receive an Intimation
from Mr. Marsden, that the late Governor
has obtained a Remission of my unexpired Time,
and consents to take me home as his Clerk.—I wait
on his Excellency accordingly, and receive orders to
go on board.—We set sail.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The process of fitting out and victualling the
Buffalo, with other causes, delayed the Governor’s
departure for some weeks after the appointed time.
At length I received, about the first of February, in
a note from Mr. Marsden, (who with his family,
had removed to Sydney, in readiness for embarkation,)
the agreeable tidings that Governor King had
consented to take me on board the Buffalo, in the
capacity of his private clerk, and had obtained the
sanction of Governor Bligh for my departure from
the colony. Mr. Marsden concluded with advising
me to wait on Governor King without delay, for the
purpose of receiving his commands. I immediately
hastened to Sydney, and waited on his Excellency;
who after some conversation, told me that the
Buffalo’s complement being already full, it was not
in his power to put me on the ship’s books<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
that he would give me a passage, and himself supply
me with provisions. He then inquired if I was
incumbered with any debts; and, on my answering
that I owed to individuals about twenty pounds, and
to Government, for various articles from the stores,
about fifteen pounds, his Excellency advised me
to take measures for settling these accompts, and,
having so done, to repair on board with the least
possible delay. I now returned to Parramatta,
(having first given the usual notice of my departure
for publication in the Sydney Gazette,) and applied
with diligence to the settlement of my affairs. I
was not displeased at the Governor’s intimation
respecting not putting me on the Buffalo’s books, because,
had he so done, it being war time, I might
have found a difficulty in getting clear of her on
our arrival in England: on the other hand, by
going home as a passenger, although I should forego
the advantage of pay, for the time occupied in our
voyage, yet I should be at liberty to quit the ship
the moment we anchored. I was not altogether so
easy with respect to my debts, as I feared my
utmost means were inadequate to their liquidation.
’Tis true, I had a watch, some good clothes, and
other effects, which altogether might suffice to discharge
my private debts, but then I should much<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
distress myself by the deprival of these useful articles.
As to my Government debt, I had a secret
hope that the generosity of Governor King (which
was often conspicuous when his privy purse was
not encroached upon,) would induce him to assist
me in surmounting that difficulty.</p>

<p>I lost not a moment in settling my business at
Parramatta, and returning to Sydney with all my
worldly goods, I waited on my principal creditor,
with whom I managed to square the yards on tolerably
easy terms. I was obliged, however, to dispose
of nearly all my personal effects, before I could
satisfy the private demands upon me, retaining only
a very limited stock of indispensable articles for my
voyage, and one genteel suit of clothes for the
purpose of attiring myself on quitting the ship,
together with an English half-guinea to bear my
expenses from Portsmouth to London. Having
taken these measures, I embarked with my chest
and bedding on the 5th of February, Governor King
and Mr. Marsden with their respective families,
being already on board. His Excellency hearing
of my arrival, sent for me to his cabin, and questioned
me on the subject of my debts. I informed
him, that I had discharged every claim upon me,
except the sum I owed to the Crown, and confessed
my inability to liquidate that account, without some
extension of his Excellency’s kind assistance. The
Governor after some moments’ reflection, wrote a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
short memorandum, which he ordered me to take
to Mr. Commissary Palmer, to whom it was addressed.
I accordingly went on shore, and proceeding
to the Commissary’s office, delivered the
note, which Mr. Palmer having read, handed to one
of his clerks, directing him to comply with the tenor
of it, which was to the following effect:—“James
Vaux (the bearer) having behaved well in the different
situations of store-keeper’s, secretary’s, and
magistrate’s clerk, I think the small sum he stands
indebted to Government ought to be remitted him.”
(Signed) “P. G. K.” The clerk having turned to
my account in the ledger, gave me credit therein, to
the amount of my debt, by an item worded as follows:—“By
remuneration for services as clerk,
<i>&amp;c.</i>” This point being adjusted, I now found
myself perfectly disembarrassed, and free to depart
the country. With a joyful heart, I took leave of
my old acquaintances and fellow-clerks, with some
of whom I spent a convivial evening, and the next
day I finally embarked, all things being now in readiness,
and the ship only waiting the auspicious
breeze. On the 10th of February, 1807, was the
happy day. At an early hour the ship was crowded
with visiters, comprising most of the principal officers
of the colony, with their ladies and friends, as
well as many respectable inhabitants, all anxious to
testify their heartfelt respect towards a departing
Governor, whose general conduct had gained him<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
universal esteem, and who had, during a government
of six years, united the tenderness of a parent with
the authority of a chief. The vessel was surrounded
with boats, some of which brought various friends
of the ship’s company, passengers, <i>&amp;c.</i>, who came
to take a last farewell; others contained spectators
of both sexes, attracted by curiosity to witness the
interesting scene, as well as to shew their loyalty
and good wishes by joining in the parting cheers,
with which the air resounded as we cleared the
heads of the harbour, to which distance most of
the boats accompanied us. About three o’clock
P. M. the breeze freshening, we quickly gained a
good offing, and by half past four a sudden squall,
attended with rain and mist, obscured from us all
view of the land, which we beheld no more.</p>

</div>

<p>The morning after our sailing, Captain King,
(as I shall in future style him,) called me into his
cabin, and presented me with a free pardon, which,
as he rightly observed, was merely a matter of form,
as it was probable we should not arrive in England
before the expiration of my time. This instrument,
though only made out a few days before, was ante-dated
the 12th of August, 1806, being the day
before Governor Bligh assumed the command, and
was consequently the last official document, to
which Governor King had affixed his signature, and
the last public act of his government.</p>

<p>In about a week, we made the island of New
Zealand, at which it was captain King’s intention
to have touched, having some live pigs, brought
from Port Jackson, for the purpose of presenting
to the native chiefs, two of whom had lately visited,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
and resided for some months in New South Wales;
but this kind idea was frustrated by a squall of
wind, which took us aback while in sight of the
island, and night coming on, it was not considered
prudent to approach the land; we therefore hauled
our wind, and shaped our course to the southward.</p>

<p>Captain King had given orders to the ship’s steward,
that I should receive his (Captain King’s) own
ration of provisions, on which I was to subsist as
well as I could. This quota (according to the
usual allowance of the navy,) would have been
amply sufficient, but by some unaccountable want
of management, the Buffalo, notwithstanding the
length of time occupied in preparation, was at
last sent to sea with a very limited supply of provisions;
nor was what she really had of the kind
or quality invariably allowed in the King’s service;
the consequence was, that on the very day of our
sailing, all hands were put upon half-allowance of
bread, (that is, half a pound per day,) and the other
half of rice: this latter grain was also substituted
on banyan days for pease and for oatmeal: of
cheese and butter we were also destitute; so that
we had not a prospect of much good living before
us. Of the rice, the crew soon became so much
tired, that they ceased to draw any from the purser,
leaving it in his hands, to be compensated for at
the end of our voyage. The salt-meat was also
barely adequate to the computed length of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
passage to Rio de Janeiro, the first port at which
we could hope for a further supply. The reader
will allow that half a pound of bread was little
enough for a man’s daily ration, (being just two
biscuits) but ere we had been six weeks at sea, it
was found necessary to reduce the allowance to
one-third of a pound; and, in a few weeks more,
it was lowered to one quarter, that is, a biscuit a
day! The necessity of these reductions arose from
a discovery that the rats, cockroaches, and other
vermin, with which the ship was infested, had
made a most destructive devastation in the bread-room,
besides which, a leak in the side had admitted
so much salt-water, that a great many bags of
biscuit were totally spoiled, thereby adding to our
distress, which was before sufficiently great. Even
the small portion of bread we did receive, was
scarcely eatable, most of it being very old stores,
and full of maggots, and what was baked in the
colony being of a very coarse quality, and every
biscuit more or less excavated by the vermin before-mentioned.
The Buffalo, as I have before shewn,
was detained several months, for the purpose of
being properly victualled, and after all, the purser
had been obliged to take a quantity of wheat in
casks, for consumption in some shape or other, as it
was found inexpedient to wait longer for a further
supply of biscuit. This wheat, when the crew
were tired of rice, was boiled in lieu of pease, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
served out at dinner-time, but it was so unpalatable
a mess, that I, among many others, could never
stomach it, being thrown into the coppers, dust and
all, boiled in stinking water, and when taken up, it
was nearly as hard as when first put in, and much inferior
to the food of pigs in England. The ship’s company
at length were convinced of their folly, in suffering
such a mode of cookery, or rather waste, for
very few could eat it; and, there being luckily a
steel-mill on board, it was ordered to be put up in
the after gun-room, and every mess in the ship, in
its turn, ground the next day’s portion of wheat
over night, and sifting the meal, produced a bag of
tolerable flour, of which the cook composed a
certain food for breakfast, known among sailors by
the name of <i>skilligolee</i>, being, in plain English,
paste, similar to that used by the sons of Crispin,
only not quite of so thick a consistence: however,
it was much preferable to the hog-wash
before-mentioned, and, with a little sugar, served as
an apology for a meal.</p>

<p>I have before observed, that I drew Captain
King’s ration of provisions, but he withheld the daily
allowance of spirits, forming part of the said ration,
which he himself received, and deposited in his private
liquor-case. It is, however, probable that his
lady, who was a rigid economist, was the suggester
of this practice. By way of composition, this good
lady gave directions that I should receive a dram<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
every day from her own steward. This trifling
indulgence by the by, was not ordered me, until the
severity of the climate compelled me to give a hint
on the subject, and after about three week’s continuance
it was put a stop to, on pretence of the
stock becoming low. Upon the whole, I suffered
a great deal from the scantiness, as well as the quality
of my allowance, and the want of certain comforts
to which I had been accustomed, particularly
during the severe weather which we encountered in
our voyage round Cape Horn. It soon appeared
that I was not to eat the bread of idleness; I was
employed from morning till night in copying and
arranging Captain King’s papers, of which he had
several large trunks full. I had also the tuition of
his daughter Miss King, who was about twelve years
of age, and performed the same duty towards Mr.
Marsden’s two children, as well as a native boy
about fourteen, who had been brought up in the
family of Mr. Marsden. This youth had received
the rudiments of a good education, and discovered a
most susceptible genius. He could read and write
tolerably well, was perfectly docile, and well-behaved,
and would doubtless have been an object of
general admiration, and reflected the highest credit
on his humane benefactors had he ever reached
England, but unhappily during our stay at Rio
Janeiro, he absconded from the house of his protectors,
in consequence of some chastisement for<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
misconduct, and, notwithstanding every exertion
was used, he could not be recovered before the ship’s
departure.</p>

<p>To add to our sufferings from the dearth of provisions,
we had not been a month at sea, before the
ship was discovered to be in a very leaky state, and
these leaks increased so rapidly, that she at length
made above five feet water in the well, every four
hours.</p>

<p>As we approached the higher latitudes, the climate
became every day more intensely cold, and we
had continual tempestuous gales for several weeks,
but fortunately they were from the right quarter, so
that we were in general before the wind, and, considering
that our ship was a very heavy sailer,
made a pretty rapid progress.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, having reached a certain
degree of longitude, I witnessed the remarkable circumstance
of gaining a day, the consequence of circumnavigating
the globe. The effect was, that the
following day, as well as this, was called in the ship’s
log, the 10th of March, so that we had actually two
Tuesdays in one week! This was a favourable circumstance
in one respect to myself and the ship’s
company, for as Tuesday is a sumptuous day in
point of allowance in the navy, beef and pudding
being the prescribed fare for dinner, we by this
accident feasted two days together; whereas had it
occurred on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
successive banyan (or starvation) days would have
been our dismal portion. On our arrival in England
our account of time after this alteration, corresponded
exactly with the almanack for the year.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March, we rounded Cape Horn,
passing within five miles of that inhospitable shore.
This point of the American continent, is situated in
fifty-six degrees of south latitude, and had we passed
it in the winter season, instead of the autumn, the
cold would have been hardly bearable; as it was,
it had the effect of destroying almost every natural
production of New South Wales, with some very
fine specimens of which our ship was at first literally
crowded, so as to resemble Noah’s Ark. There
were kangaroos, black swans, a noble emu, and
cockatoos, parrots, and smaller birds without number;
all of which, except one cockatoo, which was
carefully nursed by its mistress, and half a dozen
swans, fell victims to the severity of the weather.
The latter birds, indeed, being natives of Van Diemen’s
Land, which is a colder climate than Port
Jackson, were of a hardy nature, and survived our
long and tedious voyage. On their arrival in
England, they were sent by Captain King as a present
to the Royal Menagerie in Kew-gardens.</p>

<p>In our passage round Cape Horn, we had frequent
storms of snow; a native of New Zealand,
who had been for some time on board the Buffalo,
and was a very active intelligent fellow, expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the utmost surprise on observing a phenomenon,
which in the happy clime of his nativity is never experienced,
and in the first emotions of his admiration,
exclaimed, “Look, look, white rain, white
rain!” This man would have been an object of
curiosity in England, for he had a very handsome
person, and was punctured or tattooed in a most
fanciful and extraordinary manner from head to
foot, including his face, which was covered with
ornamental devices; but unhappily he contracted
the small-pox, which, notwithstanding all possible
attention, carried him off before we arrived at the
Brazils.</p>

<p>I must not omit a remarkable and awful phenomenon,
which occurred during this part of our
passage. In the middle of a tempestuous night,
a sudden concussion was heard, resembling the
report of a cannon close to us; it alarmed three
parts of the people who were below asleep,
as well as the watch on deck; and the general opinion
was at first, that a ship was close aboard us.
Every one hurried upon deck, when the cause was
found to have been, what is called a Fire-ball, which
had been probably attracted by the spindle at the
mast-head, for it made a rapid descent down
the main-mast, exploded at the break of the
quarter-deck; the concussion had knocked down a
quarter-master who stood near the binnacle, and
two men who were at the wheel. The former was<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
for some minutes insensible, but happily they were
no further injured than by the fright. Captain King
was instantly on deck with his usual promptness,
and fearing the effects of the fire, gave orders to
cover the magazine-scuttle with wet-swabs; then to
sound the pump-well, for some were in dread of
the ball having gone through the ship’s bottom:
however, it appeared the ship made only the usual
quantity of water, and that no real injury was sustained.
Another night, as we were scudding before
a heavy gale of wind, and a tremendous sea rolling
after us, we had the misfortune to be pooped, as
the phrase is, by a wave or sea striking our stern,
which stove in the cabin-windows, and rushing impetuously
through the cabin, and along the main-deck,
bore down all before it. Luckily no farther
damage was done than breaking the windows, which
rendered it necessary to put up the dead-lights during
the remainder of the passage.</p>

<p>When within a day or two’s sail of the River
Plate, as we were running down the coast of Brazil,
we fell in with a frigate, which, on hailing, we found
to be His Majesty’s ship Thisbe, bound to Buenos
Ayres, having on board, General Whitelocke and his
staff. This officer was going to conduct the attack
upon the city above mentioned, as well as upon
Monte Video, both belonging to the Spaniards. A
formidable expedition had been fitted out in England
for the service, and a numerous army was<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
already collected in the River Plate, waiting the arrival
of General Whitelocke. Captain King complimented
this officer with a visit on board the
Thisbe, which the latter returned. On arriving
abreast of the River Plate, the Thisbe parted from
us, steering for the entrance of that river, and we
continued our course along-shore. In a few days
we came in sight of Rio de Janeiro, but were becalmed
for two days in sight of the port. At length,
on the 22d of May, we entered that beautiful harbour,
after a most hazardous and blowing passage
of fifteen weeks. It was remarkable that on the
day before we got in, the last biscuit was issued to
the ship’s company, and the last cask of salt-meat
we possessed, was broached; so that had our passage
been longer protracted, we must have endured
still greater privations.</p>

</div>

<p>On coming to an anchor in the usual situation, we
were boarded by several persons of distinction, accompanied
by an intelligent gentleman as interpreter;
after a conference between whom and Captain
King, it was determined that the latter should without
delay address an official letter to the Viceroy,
stating the causes of his putting into that port, the
nature of his wants, and other particulars. Captain
King accordingly sketched a draught, which I was
employed to transcribe. This letter explained to
his Excellency (the Viceroy) the leaky and disabled
state of His Majesty’s ship; her want of provisions
and water, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>; and concluded with expressing
Captain King’s willingness to compliment the Portuguese
flag, by firing a salute of fifteen guns, provided
the Viceroy would pledge himself to return an
equal number. It is to be observed, that among
the Portuguese, every thing is conducted with the
utmost formality; and as they are highly jealous of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
foreigners, Captain King (whose experience was
very great in such matters) was particularly cautious
not to give any cause of offence, or to fail in due
respect; at the same time that he was determined
to support the honour of his own nation, by stipulating
for an equal interchange of ceremony, conformable
to the etiquette of the service. No foreign
vessels are suffered to proceed beyond a certain distance
within the harbour, without special permission.
One object of request in the letter was
therefore, that the Buffalo might be allowed to anchor
above the Island of Cobres, (or Snake Island)
where she could have the benefit of smooth water
to undergo the necessary repairs. Other objects
were, to be furnished with shipwrights, caulkers,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, to have a new rudder (our own being sprung)
prepared in the dock-yard, as also a new boltsprit
from the same cause, permission to land and house
the rigging and other stores in convenient receptacles;
a daily supply of fresh meat, vegetables, <i>&amp;c.</i>,
and several other similar demands. To this letter
a most gracious answer was returned, assuring
Captain King of the fullest compliance with his requisitions,
and expressing every sentiment of friendship
for the English nation, and of respect for his
person. His Excellency’s letter concluded with the
usual compliment of the Portuguese “God preserve
your Excellency many years.” At the same
time was transmitted a long table of rules and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
ceremonies, to be observed by our ship’s company,
<i>&amp;c.</i> These rules were promulgated by Captain
King, who ordered the strictest attention to be paid
thereto. They related to the times and places of
landing from boats; the behaviour of the English
when on shore; respect to be paid to the Catholic
religion and its ministers, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> Among other
injunctions it was expected that every Englishman
on passing a church should move his hat, and pay
the same compliment to the Image of the Virgin
Mary, which you encounter at the corner of every
principal street, enclosed in a sort of cupboard with
a glass-door, and silk-curtains drawn open on each
side. These cupboards are affixed to the wall, on
a level with the first-floor windows of the house,
and at night a lamp is kept burning over them,
which has a very pretty effect. It was also required that
every person, on meeting the Host (which is a grand
procession of priests, friars, <i>&amp;c.</i>, followed by an immense
rabble) should bend on one knee, and so remain
till the procession was past. The priests, on this occasion,
carry gold or silver images of our Saviour
and the saints, accompanied with musical instruments,
flags, numerous lighted flambeaus, and every
other device to render the scene at once grand,
solemn, and impressive. In fact, I witnessed various
processions of a religious nature during my stay
here, scarcely a night passing without one or more;
but it is foreign to my purpose, to enter into more<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
minute details. It being the first Catholic country
I was ever in, I was struck with admiration at the
grandeur of the churches, the nightly exhibitions of
fire-works, illuminations, ringing of bells, and other
demonstrations of religious respect, or what we
should call superstition. But I am of opinion there
is much policy in carrying these rites to such an
extravagant pitch, for the population of this city
being composed of negroes, in the proportion, I
take it, of at least nineteen to one white, and the
majority of the former being slaves, the splendour
and enchanting effects of music, paintings, fire-works,
processions, and other devices, together with
the implicit devotion in which they are brought up
to the Catholic religion, keep their minds in a continual
state of resigned subjection, amuse their
senses, and leave neither time, nor inducement to
attempt, by acts of rebellion, a release from their
habitual bondage.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative: all preliminaries being
settled to the satisfaction of both parties, Captain
King, a few days after our arrival, hired a commodious
and handsome house, ready-furnished, in a
pleasant part of the town, to which he with
his whole family removed. I, of course, accompanied
them, highly delighted at the prospect of
viewing this beautiful city, and observing the manners
and customs of its inhabitants, from which I
anticipated the greatest gratification. Mr. Marsden<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
and his family, also occupied a genteel house, and
in fact, all the passengers (of whom we had a good
number) quitted the ship, which was intended to
undergo a thorough repair.</p>

<p>During our residence ashore, I had much leisure
time, which I employed in walking throughout the
city and suburbs, viewing the churches, convents,
and other objects deserving of notice; and I endeavoured
to acquire, by every means opportunity offered,
some little knowledge of the Portuguese
language. As the latter bears a great affinity to
the Latin and French, I succeeded beyond my
hopes in this object, by virtue of which I was
enabled to extend my inquiries, and to interchange
personal civilities with many of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the street in which we resided, I had frequently
observed an old lady, together with three
young ones, sitting at the door of a genteel-looking
house, employed, according to their custom, in
weaving lace, with a number of bobbins, and a cushion
placed before them. This employment serves
both as an amusement, and a source of profit
to the younger branches of families.—They were
seated cross-legged on the floor of the parlour,
the door of which, (composed of lattice-work) was
open for the benefit of air. In the evenings I generally
saw them seated in the same manner, in conversation,
the old lady turning over her beads, of
which a string, or rosary, with a cross suspended to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
the end of it, was hung upon her wrist, and appeared
to receive her devout attention. Having repeatedly
passed this interesting group, and fancying that
they noticed me with some emotion, I ventured to
compliment them <i>en passant</i>, which courtesy they
returned with evident pleasure; and every succeeding
salutation produced a longer dialogue than the preceding;
till at length the old lady one evening invited
me to enter, and sit down; but not on the floor, for
they had chairs, as well as other furniture, of an
elegant but simple kind. These good ladies put
several questions to me respecting the English Governor
(as they styled him) my situation in his family,
name, <i>&amp;c.</i> I informed them, as fully as I could find
words for; and telling them my name in Portuguese,
they ever afterwards called me Senor Jacobe, it not
being their custom to use surnames. I had the
pleasure to find that we understood each other tolerably
well, and gathered from them, that the old
lady was called Senora Donna Joaquima Roza de
Lacè; (as the Vicar of Wakefield says, I love to
give the name at full length;) she was the widow of
a military officer in the Portuguese service, and enjoyed
a pension from the government, upon which,
and the earnings of her accomplished daughters,
she lived in a private, but genteel manner: the latter
were named Donna Anna Precioza, Donna Joaquima,
and Donna Joanina. The mother was a
most agreeable woman, courteous and affable to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
degree, but seemingly a strong devotee to her religion.
The daughters were beautiful girls, evidently
of a susceptible disposition; but, like the
Portugueze in general, very reserved, and tenacious
of their sex’s dignity. They pressed me to partake
of some coffee, which was served in with much
ceremony by a female negro; and after two or three
hours most agreeably spent, I took leave, with an
earnest injunction to repeat my visit.</p>

<p>From this time hardly a day passed without my
calling on this worthy family, and at every visit we
parted with a stronger regard for each other. I felt
a growing sentiment in favour of the eldest daughter
(Anna,) and I ingratiated myself with the mother,
by warmly praising the Catholic religion, shewing
my respect by kissing the cross attached to her
beads, and every other means in my power. In a
few days I became, as it were, one of the family,
visiting them at all hours, and experiencing the kindest
welcome. The ladies took a pleasure in improving
my knowledge in their language, and in return
requested me to teach them my own. At this
period there were very few English persons in the
Brazils; but the inhabitants, in general, evinced the
greatest fondness for our nation; so that not the
meanest of our ship’s company could walk the
streets without being gratified with hearing the exclamation
of “Sta bon Inglise,” (very good Englishman,)
from the mouths of passengers, both men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
women, and children. Myself and other persons,
whose appearance was at all respectable, were also
very courteously saluted by the females, who stand
for hours peeping through the lattice-windows of
the houses, which are half opened, so as to give them
a view, and although most of these diffident ladies
close the lattice and retire with precipitation, on the
approach of a male stranger, yet many of them suffered
me to hold a conversation for a few minutes;
and I sometimes prevailed so far as to obtain one of
their fair hands to kiss, a mark of great favour and
condescension, even to their common acquaintances.</p>

<p>Captain King received every possible mark of respect
both public and private, during his residence in
this city. Whenever he appeared abroad in an open
chaise, (which he hired by the month,) or on horseback,
the military-guard at every public post which he
passed, were turned out to pay him the same honours
as are usually rendered to the viceroy himself. The
latter officer also shewed him every attention, frequently
exchanging visits with him, lending him
his own horses for a ride, <i>&amp;c.</i> Most of the principal
inhabitants paid their respects to Mrs. King,
and invited her to various public and private entertainments.
The Portuguese excel in music, particularly
the violin and bass-viol; and there were
frequently large parties of amateurs at our house,
who formed a most delightful evening concert.
This is, in fact, the custom of all people of fashion<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
there, who, instead of meeting for the purpose of
gaming as in London, adopt this much more laudable
and rational mode of amusement.</p>

<p>I observed, as I traversed the city, that a number
of bonfires were lighted in various streets, as soon
as it grew dusk, almost every evening, which were
surrounded by children, negroes, and others, rejoicing
until a late hour. As these fires were never
twice in the same spot, I was at a loss to understand
their meaning, until I at length ascertained that they
were in celebration of the birth-days of children.
The custom of observing such days differs, however,
from our own country; for instead of taking place
on the anniversary of the child’s nativity, the observation
is confined to the festival of that particular
Saint after whom the child is named; for instance,
on St. Anna’s day, all persons who have a daughter
called Anna, celebrate the same by regaling their
friends, and having a bonfire before their door. As
almost every day in the year is dedicated to a male
or female saint, whose name is borne by some
hundreds of children, these bonfires are, of course,
frequent and numerous. The effect of them is
both lively and gratifying, especially to those who
know their cause; but many of the streets being
extremely narrow, and some of the fires very large,
I have been frequently much embarrassed to effect
a passage, in which attempt I was sometimes
in danger of being scorched by the intense heat<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
reflected from the stone walls of which the houses
are composed.</p>

<p>Another object of my attention was the slave-market,
which is held on the arrival of a Guinea
ship, in the suburbs of the city. These unfortunate
beings are chained together, and driven to the scene
of this disgraceful traffic, where they are sold like
cattle or sheep in Smithfield. A healthy youth of
about fifteen will produce from about thirty to fifty
pounds, this being considered the most advantageous
age at which a slave can be purchased.
The condition of this unhappy class of persons is,
however, much more tolerable in this city than a
stranger would suppose. Most of the inhabitants
possess a male or female, (some several,) exclusive
of those employed in household affairs. These
superfluous slaves are sent out in a morning to ply
for hire on their owner’s account, and obtain as
much as they can by their labour; the majority of
the women confine themselves to carrying water
from the fountains, which they cry as the venders of
milk do in London; and on being hailed, they stop
and empty their vessel, for which they receive a
vintain, (about three halfpence;) they then return
to the nearest fountain to replenish. I could not
help being surprised at the large size of the vessels
in which they carry this water on their heads; they
are a kind of wooden casks, some of them holding
at least ten gallons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>Having mentioned the public fountains, (with
which this city abounds,) it may not be amiss to describe
them. There being but few springs in the
town, water is conveyed by means of a noble brick
aqueduct (communicating with others,) from a distance
of several miles through the interior, over the
summits of many high hills, and being distributed
throughout the city, it supplies a fountain in most
of the principal streets. These fountains are handsomely
constructed of stone, having a large cistern
into which the purest water is constantly running
from the beaks of several ducks, geese, or
other birds, which are of cast metal, and well executed.
As the trade of water-carrying furnishes
employment for many hundreds of negro women,
and their continual resort to the fountains would occasion
much confusion and quarrelling, a soldier is
placed in attendance to preserve order, and the
women seat themselves in a row on a long bench
fixed on purpose, where they are obliged to wait for
their turn to fill. It is a curious and interesting
sight to observe these harmless and industrious
creatures conversing with each other, and smoking
their pipes, while they patiently await the sentinel’s
intimation to approach. The incessant prattle of
their tongues may be heard by a passenger long before
he reaches the spot, and adds to the novelty of
the scene.</p>

<p>The negroes I saw here, the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
whom are natives, born of those imported from
Africa, or of their descendants, are upon the whole
the most comely race of blacks I ever met with.
The men wear coarse jackets and trowsers, the
women a sort of gown of blue cloth; but their linen
is always remarkably white, of a fine texture, and
beautifully wrought with ornamental work about
the sleeves and bosom. They have also bracelets
both on the wrists and ancles, and ear-rings, all of
the purest gold. Both sexes are very cleanly in
their persons, and of a most docile and gentle disposition.</p>

<p>By the kindness of my worthy friends, the ladies,
I obtained frequent admission to the Opera, (as it
is called, though the pieces I saw appeared to be
principally comedies and farces, with scarcely any
vocal music.) As I could not understand the plot,
or dialogue, my chief satisfaction was in contemplating
the <i>coup d’œil</i>, which was very striking.
The house is about the size of our little theatre in
the Haymarket; the pit is solely occupied by the
male sex, but the boxes are filled with beautiful
women, dressed in the most elegant and bewitching
manner, and adorned with brilliant ear-rings, bracelets,
<i>&amp;c.</i> The viceroy has an elegant box in the
centre of the front tiers, so as to be immediately
facing the stage, and to be seen by the whole
audience. The performance is never suffered to
commence till his arrival, which is sometimes protracted;<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
and on his Excellency’s entrance, the whole
of the spectators rise to testify their respect for his
person. The admission to the pit is only a petack
(two shillings.) The boxes are engaged by parties,
at the expense of about twelve shillings each,
whether the party is large or small; and there
is no gallery. The music is excellent and the band
numerous.</p>

<p>Were I to attempt a minute description of the
magnificent churches, convents, and other buildings,
the numerous processions, public rejoicings, <i>&amp;c.</i>;
the beautiful gardens, romantic walks, and other
objects worthy of the most scrupulous attention,
which I met with in this rich and flourishing city,
as well as the various customs and manners peculiar
to its inhabitants, I should swell this work
much beyond the limits I have prescribed; but as
I am inadequate to the task, I shall leave such a
subject to some abler pen; and as I only profess to
write an account of my own adventures, shall resume
the thread of my narrative.</p>

<p>I was so much delighted with all I saw, and found
the climate so congenial to my constitution, that I
could have been content to have spent the rest of my
life in South America; and hinting as much to my
kind friends, the old lady seriously pressed me to
that measure, assuring me of her protection and interest,
together with that of her friends, who were
numerous and respectable. She even pledged herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
to procure me a salary of one doubloon (about
£3. 12<i>s.</i>) per month, at the first onset, as clerk in
a mercantile house, which would be increased as I
acquired the Portugueze language. But that longing
desire to re-visit my native country, which is
predominant in the breast of every Englishman, together
with a wish to see once more my beloved
relations to whom I owed so much, prevailed over
every other consideration; and I declined, but with
a proper sense of gratitude, these flattering offers of
favour and service.</p>

<p>Since my departure from Portsmouth, in 1801, I
had not heard a syllable of or from any of my friends
in England, and though it was probable that my
dear benefactors in S⸺ had ere this period paid
the debt of nature, I felt a secret hope that they
might still survive, and that from the favourable
situation in which I stood with Captain King I
might, at no very distant period, find myself enabled
to contribute some little assistance towards rendering
the evening of their lives happy. It was my
firm determination never again to swerve from a
course of rectitude; and I had the fullest confidence
that the late governor, my patron, would procure
me the means of adhering to so laudable a resolution.
How fatally I was mistaken, how uncertain
are the favours of the great, will be seen in a future
chapter.</p>

<p>The Buffalo having been as effectually repaired<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
as circumstances would admit, and a tolerable supply
of provisions received on board, every preparation
was made for prosecuting our voyage, and a
day appointed for sailing. As the latter period approached,
I redoubled my respectful attentions to
the worthy family in the Strada de los Mongares, (or
Monkey-street,) and they every day gave stronger
proofs of their concern at my approaching departure.
The day at length arrived, and I waited on
them to take a final leave. On this occasion many
tears were shed on their part, and I confess my
sensibility was such that I involuntarily caught the
soft infection. I obtained the favour of a warm
embrace from them all, and the young ladies condescended
to deviate from their usual strict decorum
by suffering me to imprint some ardent kisses on
their charming lips. The mother appeared a little
disconcerted at this indulgence, but her affection for
me prevented any expressions of displeasure; she
herself presented me her cheek with a very good
grace. I must here observe, that the Portugueze
ladies do not allow even their lovers, before marriage,
a greater license than kissing the hand; this
intimation was given me on my first acquaintance
with Donna Joaquima, by that worthy matron herself,
with a very serious air, as she discovered, I
suppose, that I evinced too much warmth in my
attention to her lovely daughters. After numerous
repetitions of “Adieu” on my side, and of “Dios<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
guarda, mio Amigo,” (God preserve you, my friend,)
on that of these amiable females, I was obliged to
tear myself abruptly from them; and with a heart
overcharged with grief and tenderness, I hastened
to the boat, which conveyed myself and the few
other persons remaining on shore, to the ship, which
was then under weigh, and, the breeze freshening,
we with difficulty got alongside her, when abreast
of Fort Santa Cruz, (near the entrance of the Rio
de Janeiro,) and just as the Buffalo was saluting that
battery. In about an hour afterwards, we cleared
the Heads; the same evening (August the 12th
1807,) we lost sight of the coast of Brazil, and proceeded
on our course for Europe.</p>

<p><i>The Ship becomes as leaky as before.—All hands in
turn at the Pumps.—Means adopted to reduce the
Leaks.—I offend the late Governor, who orders
me before the Mast.—Fall in with the Thisbe a
second time, in company with several Transports.—Unhappy
fate of one of them.—Arrive at Spithead.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Having resumed our voyage with a favouring
breeze, and the ship being, to all appearance, tight
and sea-worthy, with a pretty ample supply of wet
and dry provisions, our prospects were now a little
more cheering; and I looked forward with innate
satisfaction to the moment when I should set my
foot on English ground, free from the horrors attending
a state of bondage, and at liberty to realize
the ideas I had formed of atoning to society, and to
my own conscience for the manifold errors of my
past life.</p>

<p>We had, however, the mortification to find that
the repairs the ship had undergone at Rio de Janeiro,
had only produced a temporary effect; for
shortly after leaving that port, the ship again began
to leak, and in a few days made as much water as
before. The consequence was that all hands, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
officers, were obliged to take their turn at
the pumps, and it was only by pumping her out
every watch that she could be kept free. I, of
course, took my spell at this necessary but fatiguing
labour during the day, without murmuring; but I
was not disturbed in the night, which, indeed, I
considered would have been unfair, as I was on
duty all day. The carpenter found, on inspection,
that the principal leak was occasioned by some part
of the stem being loose, where there was a large
aperture some feet under water. Every exertion
was made, by lightening her forwards, and applying
what is termed a fothering mat to her bows, to remedy
this evil, but without effect; for the working of the
ship occasioned every particle of the stuffing used
on such occasions to wash out immediately. This
expedient, indeed, at first, promised to succeed to
admiration, for it decreased the leak from sixteen to
ten inches an hour; but the experiment was made
in a calm, and the first rough weather undid all that
had been done. It was now discovered that certain
parts of the stem, called the fore-hoods, were loose,
which occasioned the principal leak; and this was
so far under water, that it was impossible to repair
the defect while the ship was afloat. In fact, she
was altogether in a very decayed state, being an old
ship, and having endured much severe service; so
that having now a voyage of three months before
us, and reason to expect bad weather, as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
should approach the English channel in the winter
season, those who were best able to form an opinion
entertained serious doubts of the ship’s capability
to perform the voyage; however, these doubts were
not suffered to transpire publicly, and every precaution,
which the experience of Captain King and
his officers could dictate, was made use of. The
stem, of the vessel, being the most defective part,
was first secured, by passing very strong ropes over
her bows, and under her keel, which were then
boused taut athwart the fore-castle, and there made
fast, in order to lash her bows together; for some
fears existed that by the violent working of the ship
in a head sea, her bows would absolutely part asunder!
That she might be strained as little as possible,
it was also determined not to carry a press of
sail on the boltsprit when sailing on a wind. In this
manner we continued our course for several weeks,
without any incident worthy of notice; we had upon
the whole pretty favourable winds, but as we approached
the equator they were interrupted by occasional
calms.</p>

<p>On the 17th of September, we crossed the equinoctial
line, with the usual ceremonies, in which
every officer and passenger cordially joined, and not
a single person (the ladies and Captain King excepted,)
escaped a complete ducking. The weather
being delightfully fine, with a light and favourable
breeze, every one was in high spirits, and the rites<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
of Neptune having been celebrated in due form,
a plentiful allowance of grog succeeded, which, by
wetting the inside, made ample amends for the salt-water
baptism, which all hands had mutually and
liberally bestowed on each other without respect
to rank or persons. This was a remarkable day
with me, for on this day my original term of transportation
expired. This event naturally produced
a train of reflections in my mind. I took a retrospect
of the miseries and vicissitudes I had undergone
within the last seven years, and I returned
fervent thanks to Heaven for my deliverance from
exile, and for the unlimited freedom which I expected
shortly to regain. But, alas! I was soon to
experience another reverse, which, as it was both
unexpected and unmerited, fell with the greater
weight upon me: and thus it happened.</p>

<p>Hitherto, as I have before observed, I was not
called upon in the night to take my spell at the
pumps, but a few days after our crossing the line,
by what accident I knew not, I was desired by the
boatswain’s mate of the watch, to turn out in the
middle of a wet and windy night, and pump ship.
As remonstrance with such a fellow as this would
have availed nothing, I complied; but the next day
took an opportunity of acquainting Captain King,
and requested he would give directions that I should
not be disturbed in future. To my great surprise,
however, he informed me, that I had been called<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
upon by his express orders, and that he was ignorant
till that very night of my being excused from the
duty of pumping, but had taken for granted that I
always took my spell. I replied to this by submitting
in the most respectful terms, that as I was
employed in writing, <i>&amp;c.</i>, from morning till night,
and also assisted in pumping the ship every watch,
it was but fair that I should sleep every night, as all
persons under the denomination of “Idlers” invariably
do in king’s ships. Captain King rejoined
that the emergency of the case required every one
to assist; that he had given orders to have no idler
or other person excused, and that he should therefore
insist on my compliance. I observed that he
grew warm towards the end of this conference,
though I had preserved the respect due to him,
in all I had said; however, as I was conscious of
being in the right, I ventured to hint that the situation
in which I stood, being only a passenger not
belonging to the ship, receiving neither pay nor even
the allowance of spirits common to the meanest
cabin-boy in the service, and which was essentially
necessary to support the united hardships of labour
and inclement weather; that all these considerations
might, I submitted, entitle me to some distinction
from the class of persons called idlers, who actually
belonged to the ship; and I concluded with an intimation
that the emergency of the case could not
be so great as that my feeble assistance could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
be dispensed with, as the ship was always freed from
water with ease in half an hour, and not one of his
(Captain King’s,) domestic servants, who were stout
able men, (five or six in number,) and all receiving
pay from the ship, were ever called upon at all in
the night, and but rarely in the day. The justice
of my remonstrances appeared to have exasperated
Captain King, who was of a very irascible temper,
and he at length worked himself up into a violent
rage, the consequence of which was (as usual with
him,) a torrent of abuse; and as I knew by experience
that it was in vain to attempt pacifying him,
when in this mood, I quitted the cabin, and retired
to my birth between decks. About an hour after,
as I was sitting on my chest ruminating on the unpleasant
situation in which I was placed, and heartily
wishing for the moment which was to free me from
a state of dependence, I was accosted by a master’s
mate, who informed me it was Captain King’s orders
that I should do my duty in the larboard watch of
the after-guard, and that I was to be mustered with
the watch at eight o’clock the same night. I now
clearly saw the malevolence of Captain King’s designs,
and the illiberal advantage he was about to
take of my helpless and dependent situation. I
nevertheless cheerfully obeyed his orders, and that
night kept what is termed the first watch, (from
eight to twelve,) two hours of which I was stationed
at the lee-wheel. At twelve o’clock I retired to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
hammock, and was no more interrupted till eight
the next morning, soon after which I was summoned
to the cabin of Captain Houston, the acting commander
of the Buffalo under Captain King, who, on
my appearing before him, inquired abruptly, “if I
chose to enter?” I was not surprised at this question,
as I had foreseen in what manner Captain King
intended to act, in order to place me more immediately
in his power, and to give him an authority
over me, which as I was before situated he did not
possess. Being, therefore, prepared for such a
question, and knowing the nature of the service,
I answered Captain Houston in the affirmative.
The latter then ordered me to attend the captain’s
clerk, and get myself duly entered on the ship’s
books. This I accordingly did, and now found
myself suddenly placed in the capacity of a common
sailor on board a king’s ship; and it being war time,
I had before me the disheartening prospect of being
drafted, on our arrival in England, on board some
other ship, (without a probable chance of once setting
my foot on shore,) and of being perhaps immediately
ordered abroad to some foreign station from
which I might not return for several years. My
motive for voluntarily entering was this: I was
aware that had I refused to do so it was in the
power of Captain King to press me against my will,
and I doubt not but such was his intention. In the
latter case I should have been entered as a pressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
man, which might have operated at a future day
against my obtaining leave to go ashore, and by that
means effect my escape; whereas I was now entered
as a volunteer, and became entitled to a small
bounty. I am persuaded the reader will view this
conduct of Captain King’s in a very unfavourable
light; as I had really been guilty of no crime, it was
taking a most cruel and illiberal advantage of the
power he had over me. Having released me from
a state of banishment, and taken me into his service
on the terms he did, without any immediate compensation,
he had of course left me every reason to
expect, not only my liberty at the end of the voyage,
but also his future countenance and protection.
Besides, the reader will remember that he had declined
putting me on the ship’s books when I first
joined her at Port Jackson, in which case I should
have had nine months’ pay to receive on my subsequent
arrival in England, and should have also had
a daily allowance of spirits during the passage, for
want of which I had suffered much in the cold climate
and severe weather we encountered; instead
of which, and after I had actually become a free-man
by servitude, he had forced me into what may be
termed a second bondage, almost equally irksome with
the first, and that too when within six weeks of the
end of our voyage. However, as I am of opinion
with Shakspeare, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Things without remedy should be without regard.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">I bore up with fortitude against this unexpected reverse
of fortune; and, conscious of its being unmerited,
made no attempt to avert the blow by
mean submission, to which I could not stoop. I
therefore cheerfully took my watch on deck, and,
when not so engaged, amused myself below with a
book, or in ruminating (as usual with me,) on the instability
of human affairs, and the vicissitudes of my
own life in particular. It was not the least of my
consolations in this distress, that I received every
day at noon half a pint of excellent rum, with a dram
of which I fortified myself occasionally during the
night watches, for as we approached the channel of
Old England, we once more experienced a sudden
change of climate, and the weather became intensely
cold.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the event I have just related,
Captain King, finding I was perfectly reconciled
to my new duty, and that I offered no apology,
as he perhaps expected I would, sent for me one
morning, and ordered me to attend in the cabin
every day at nine o’clock, for the purpose of writing
as usual. As I did not conceive myself justified in
refusing, I complied, and paid every attention to his
commands. The boatswain’s mates, understanding
how I was again employed, desisted from calling
me up to pump ship for several nights; when by
some means Captain King hearing of this fact,
actually gave orders that I should regularly turn out<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
as well as the other idlers. This I considered such
a proof of his determined wish to oppress and
harass me, that I ventured a second remonstrance
on the subject; when he again fell into a violent rage,
and cautioned me not to offend him by a repetition
of (what he termed,) my insolence, reminding me
that it was now in his power to flog me, though it
was not before!</p>

<p>He concluded with saying, that he left it to my
choice either to write for him during the day, and
take my turn at pumping in the night, or to do my
duty before the mast entirely, and keep my watch
in common with the rest of the crew. I made no
hesitation in replying, that, with his permission, I
should prefer doing my duty on deck. To this he
assenting, I made my bow and withdrew. Here
ended my functions in the clerical capacity with
Captain King. From this day I never wrote a line
for him; and thus was I rewarded for my past services.
To shew the inconsistency of this treatment,
I will just quote a line from the pardon granted me
by himself, when Governor of New South Wales.
In documents of this description, it is indispensably
required to state the grounds, or motives, which induce
the Governor to exercise the power vested in
him by His Majesty’s instructions. The blank
left for that purpose, was thus filled up, “I, Philip
Gidley King, Esquire, Captain general, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i>,
taking into consideration the good conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
James Vaux, and to enable him to serve as my
clerk on board His Majesty’s ship Buffalo, Do
hereby absolutely remit, <i>&amp;c.</i>”</p>

<p>Just before we entered the channel, we had the
singular fortune to fall in a second time with the
Thisbe frigate, in company with three sail of transports.
On speaking, we ascertained that the latter
vessels had on board a part of the army, lately under
the command of General Whitelocke in the Rio de
la Plata, and who had survived the ill-managed and
fatal attack upon Buenos Ayres. We also learnt
that the general himself had been put under
arrest for his deficiency and misconduct on that occasion,
and was now on his voyage home to answer
for the same. Captain King now represented to
the agent on board one of these transports, the distressed
state of the Buffalo, and requested the aid of
some soldiers to assist in pumping her, as the leaks
daily grew more alarming. Forty privates were
accordingly put on board us, and we continued our
voyage in company with the transports, the Thisbe
having outsailed us. About the 5th of November
we made the land, which proved the coast of Cornwall,
near Falmouth. We proceeded along shore
to the eastward, and on the 8th came to an anchor at
Spithead, (after a passage of nine months from port
Jackson,) in company with two of the transports,
but the third was missing. We had afterwards the
melancholy information that this vessel (the John<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
and Elizabeth,) had been wrecked during the preceding
night, having struck upon some rocks in
consequence of her keeping too near the shore; and
it blowing a fresh gale, she went to pieces, when
upwards of three hundred persons unhappily
perished.</p>

</div>

<p>The anchor was no sooner down, than the cutter
was hoisted out, in which Captain King went ashore
and immediately proceeded post to London. The
following day the Buffalo weighed, and sailed into
Portsmouth harbour, where she was lashed alongside
a hulk near the shore, and preparations instantly
made for clearing and dismantling her, preparatory
to her survey and expected condemnation.
Those persons who had obtained a passage on
various accounts, and were not on the ship’s books,
were now permitted to dis-embark, and depart to
their respective homes. I now felt the full weight
of the misery in which I was involved. After an
absence of nearly seven years from my native land,
to enjoy once more the sight of that much-loved<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
spot, and when within a hundred yards of the shore,
to be debarred from a nearer approach, was mortifying
in the extreme, and my situation could only be
compared to that of Tantalus in the Heathen mythology.
The purser was now busily intent upon
making up the Buffalo’s books, to be transmitted to
the Navy-office, previous to her being paid, and
her crew drafted into other ships. As these accounts
were extensive, and required both care and
expedition, Mr. Sherard, the purser, requested that
I would assist the captain’s clerk of the ship in their
arrangement, for which he obtained the sanction of
Captain Houston, promising to reward me for my
trouble. I was now excused from all other duty,
and immediately set about the required task with
alacrity, conceiving hopes that I might by this compliance
facilitate my grand object of escaping from
the ship. By dint of unremitting assiduity we completed
the whole of the accounts in about a fortnight,
to the satisfaction of the purser, and I had no
sooner acquitted myself of this duty than Captain
Houston requested I would bring up his journal,
which was many months in arrear. I gladly undertook
this service, from the same motives as before,
and now wrote from morning till night in the cabin,
Captain King and his family having totally quitted
the ship, and taken lodgings in Portsmouth, as had
also Captain Houston and his lady. The latter
officer came on board daily, and was highly pleased<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
at the progress I made in his journal. Captain
King also came on board occasionally, but did not
deign to notice me, and I preserved the same strangeness
towards him.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival, I had written to an aunt
in London, for information respecting my father,
and other relations. About this time I received,
in consequence, a letter from my mother, informing
me that my father and grandmother had been deceased
about two years, and that my venerable
grandfather was still living at S⸺ in health and
spirits; she added that herself and my two sisters
were residing in Middle-row, Holborn, and should
feel inexpressibly happy at seeing me again. My
whole thoughts were now turned to the object of
getting ashore, but the <i>quo modo</i> was to be considered,
and of this I could form no idea. I could
not swim; I had no money to bribe a waterman to
fetch me away; and of gaining my liberty I had little
or no hopes. I still continued assiduous in writing
the journal for Captain Houston and I had reason to
build upon some indulgence from the first lieutenant
Mr. Oxley<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, should it rest with him to grant leave
of absence, as I had occasionally written his log,
during the voyage, and he had been pleased to shew
me many marks of kindness.</p>

<p>After the pay-books were completed and sent up
to London, I one day had some conversation with<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
a respectable looking woman, who attended the ship
with a bum-boat, and supplied the sailors with necessaries
on the credit of their approaching pay,
which was considerable, the ship having been
six years stationed in New South Wales. As this
woman appeared to possess some sensibility, I ventured
to represent to her the distress I was in at
my confinement to the service, and particularly my
fears that I should not obtain leave to visit my
friends before I was sent to sea again. The good
woman, whose name was B⸺y, had sufficient
penetration to perceive my drift, and that I wanted
to take French leave of an English man-of-war.
After expatiating on the risk she should incur in case
of a discovery, and many injunctions of secrecy, she
declared her willingness to assist me as far as lay in
her power, as she had, she said, children of her own
and pitied my situation. She then advised me to
pack up a suit of clothes, (which I informed her I
had by me,) and commit them to her care, saying,
that she would take them privately to her lodgings,
to which she directed me, and that I must next contrive
to get ashore on duty, or by any other means,
when I should immediately come to her, and she
would assist me in my further proceedings. Having
treated this worthy creature with a glass of grog,
and overwhelmed her with thanks for her disinterested
kindness, (for such it certainly was,) I hastened
to put up my clothes, consisting of a genteel black<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
coat, boots, <i>&amp;c.</i>, which I had preserved for the purpose,
and on her quitting the ship she concealed
these articles among her merchandise without observation.
This took place on a Thursday, and my
only concern now, was to make good my landing.
On the following Sunday it was promulgated
throughout the ship, that a certain number of the
crew were to be allowed leave to go on shore in the
afternoon. I determined, therefore, to make an effort,
and the dinner hour being over, I heard orders given
to man the cutter for the liberty-men. The latter
were in the mean time busily employed in rigging
themselves for the occasion, in their best togs. I, of
course, intended to go in my working dress, consisting
of a red flannel shirt, blue jacket, and tarry
trowsers, as I thought the officers would less suspect
me of a design to run away. Full of anxiety
but not without hope, I entered the gun-room, in
which were Mr. Oxley, then commanding officer
of the ship, and Mr. Sherard the purser. The
former inquiring my business, I answered, that I
wished, with his permission, to go on shore for two
or three hours, having a friend in Portsmouth, who
I was in hopes would supply me with some necessaries
I stood in need of. Mr. Oxley smiled and
hesitated, remarking the shabbiness of my appearance;
at length on my urging my suit, with a trembling
voice, (for no one who has not been similarly
situated, can conceive what I then felt,) he inquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
if he might depend on my returning on board at
sun-set in the ship’s boat? I assured him that he
might, and he then consented to my going. Having
thanked him from the bottom of my heart, I quitted
the gun-room, but had no sooner closed the door
than I was recalled by Mr. Oxley. Somewhat
alarmed lest he should be about to retract, I returned,
and found I was called at the instance of Mr.
Sherard, who, drawing out his purse, presented me
with half-a-guinea! saying, he had promised me
something for my late assistance. I thanked him
and again withdrew. I had scarcely shut the door
a second time, when I was again recalled, which
still more surprised and alarmed me. On re-entering,
Mr. Oxley said, (but in what I thought a good-natured
way,) “Mind, Mr. Vaux, if you’re not on
board by six o’clock, I shall send the marines after
you.” I again promised obedience, and once more
retired. I then hastened to inform a friend of my
good fortune, and gave him the key of my chest,
desiring him, in case I did not return in the evening,
to take out such articles as he chose, as well as my
bedding, <i>&amp;c.</i>, before they were seized by order of
the captain. On ascending the deck I was again
alarmed. The acting master, who was on the
quarter-deck, seeing me about to enter the boat,
called me aft, and inquired where I was going? I
answered that Mr. Oxley had given me leave to go
ashore. He replied, “Mr. Oxley, I am sure, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
never give you leave to go ashore in that dirty
dress;” and absolutely forbad my going. It was in
vain that I remonstrated, and referred him to Mr.
Oxley; and during the delay occasioned by this conversation,
the boat was on the point of departure;
when, luckily, the master turning his back to give
some orders, I hastily descended to the Waist,
and leaping through one of the midship ports,
found myself happily in the cutter, at the moment
when the coxswain gave the word to shove
off. I concealed myself in the foresheets until out
of danger, and in about ten minutes was landed at
Common-Hard. I need not labour to paint the
joy I felt at that moment, though it was certainly
mixed with anxiety as to my further success. I immediately
left the other liberty-men, who pressed
me in vain to drink with them; and pleading urgent
business, ran with the utmost expedition along the
streets, inquiring for the Point, where having arrived,
I found several ferry-boats ready to cross
over to Gosport. A fellow calling out “over, Sir?”
I jumped into his boat, and in a few minutes found
myself on Gosport-beach. Thus far, I sailed
before the wind; I walked up the beach, and the
first object that presented itself was the London
stage-coach, standing at the door of the Red Lion
Inn. This novel sight which I had not beheld for
so many years, was so gratifying that I admired and
examined it for some minutes, as minutely as a country<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
man would do the King’s state-coach. I soon
found on inquiry, the lodgings of Mrs. B⸺y which
were at a public-house near the Red Lion. On
asking for her of the landlady, I had the mortification
to learn that she was out on board of some
ship, and that her return was uncertain. It was
now near four o’clock, and the days being short,
my term of leave would soon expire. However, as
there was no remedy but patience, I entered the
tap-room, and calling for a pint of ale and a pipe,
sat down to wait the arrival of my worthy friend.
I had scarcely taken a dozen whiffs when I heard
a footstep in the passage of the house; and my
landlady putting out her head, inquired “Is that
you, Mrs. B⸺y?” I had the pleasure to hear
that good woman answer, “Yes.” On the landlady
informing her there was a young man waiting
for her, she opened the door; and seeing me, said
with a significant look, and evidently much pleased,
“O, is that you, William, step up stairs with me,
and I’ll give you those things.” I paid for my ale,
and followed Mrs. B⸺y, who was accompanied
by her husband, and both of them loaded with goods
they had brought from their boat. On entering
their apartment, they expressed much pleasure at
my good luck in getting ashore, and gave me the
most cordial welcome. The old woman put on
the tea-kettle, and while it was boiling, she looked
out my clothes, which she set about airing by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
fire. Having obliged me to take a dram, they began
to consult on the measures to be adopted in my
favour. Mr. B⸺y informed me that the coach I
had seen would set out at six o’clock; that the
inside fare to London was twenty-four shillings, and
the outside seventeen shillings, inquiring, which I
would prefer, and how I stood for cash. I answered
that I had about twenty-four shillings,
(namely the half guinea I had brought from New
South Wales, another which I had received from
the purser, and three or four shillings I had acquired
since our arrival,) but that an outside place would
answer my purpose, and I should then have a trifle
for expenses. This worthy couple assured me I
should not be lost for a few shillings, if I found
myself at all deficient; but I declined this favour,
knowing I could make shift with what I had. Mr.
B⸺y then offered to go himself to the coach-office,
and secure me a place. I accordingly gave
him the required sum, and he hastened to the Red
Lion. During his absence Mrs. B⸺y gave me
some warm water to wash myself, which having
done, she desired me to put on all my clothes but
my coat; she then put an apron over my shoulders,
and proceeded to dress my hair as well as she
could, and, for want of powder, made use of
some flour, with which she plentifully whitened
my head. Having put on my coat, she next threw
some flour over my back, and taking a view of me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
declared she never saw so great an alteration
in a man. She complimented me upon my genteel
appearance, and added, that she was sure if I was
met by any of my own officers, they would not
know me in this garb. Her husband now returning,
informed me that he had taken a place for me in
the name of Lowe, as I directed, and had told the
coachman to take me up at the Dolphin Inn, near
the extremity of the town. Every thing being now
arranged, I anxiously wished for the hour of six;
and though I had not the least grounds for fear, yet
I could not wholly divest myself of it. It is true, as
I had landed at Portsmouth, it was not likely, in case
there was any suspicion, that a search would be set
afoot in Gosport, which is on the opposite side of
the harbour; besides, no inquiry was likely to be
made for me, till after six o’clock, at which hour
the coach would set off. Having taken a dish of
tea, and the time approaching, I took an affectionate
leave of the good woman, promising to write
to her on my arrival in town, and at a future day
to reward her kindness. The old man insisted on
accompanying me to the Dolphin, and seeing
me safe off. The weather being intensely cold,
they would have pressed me to accept a great-coat,
but I refused to trespass further on their
goodness. At length we departed, and walked
without interruption to the Dolphin; but I tremble
at the approach of every officer or genteel person<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_I_Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
we met, so great was my fear of miscarriage on this
important occasion. Having some minutes to wait
for the coach, Mr. B⸺y insisted on my drinking a
parting glass at the bar of an adjacent public-house,
which having done, we heard the joyful sound of
the horn, and the rattling of the coach-wheels. In
a few minutes I ascended the vehicle, and as it drove
off, I saw my worthy old friend waving his hand at
the corner of the street, apparently as much
affected as myself on the occasion. Having thus
described my escape from a state of thraldom, in
which I might otherwise have suffered much vexation
and hardship, I shall here conclude the twenty-first
chapter of my Memoirs.</p>

<p>About four miles from Gosport, is a place
called Fareham, where is a gate, through which on
the coach passing, I had always understood that the
passengers were subject to an overhaul, as the sailors
term it. I was, therefore, somewhat alarmed during
this part of my journey. I felt confident, however,
that I could give a good account of myself, had I been
questioned; but to my great joy, on our approach,
the gate was thrown open, and the coach passed
without stopping. I now felt extremely cold, and
my dress being thin, I suffered much during the
night. In order to counteract the effects of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
frost, I fortified myself with a good dram of brandy
at every stage, and the ensuing morning proving
delightfully fine, I at length found both my animal
and mental spirits revive, and my heart beat high
with expectation of the happiness I anticipated.
About eight o’clock I was gratified with a sight of
Hyde Park Corner; and I leave the reader to imagine
what transports I felt at the difference between
my then situation and that from which I had so
recently and happily emerged. On my ascending
the coach at Gosport, I had placed myself on the
roof between two men who had the appearance of
country farmers, and I maintained that situation
throughout the night, by which indeed I was something
benefited, for they had both good great-coats,
and we sitting rather crowded, I was warmer than I
should otherwise have been. On the coach stopping
at the Gloucester Coffee-house, Piccadilly, I
expressed my intention to alight and walk; the
two farmers had the same inclination, and I observed,
that if they were going my way, I should be
glad of their company. They answered they were
strangers in town, and their only object was to find
out the inn from which the Yorkshire coach set out,
as they were about proceeding to that county immediately.
I replied, I was myself almost a stranger
to those matters, but I fancied the inn lay in the
way I was going, and that I would with pleasure
conduct them to it. We accordingly set forwards,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and walked through Piccadilly, the Haymarket,
Strand, <i>&amp;c.</i>, until we came to Fetter-lane; and arriving
at the White Horse, I was, I found, right in
my conjecture, for the York coach was among the
number of those advertised in large characters on
each side the gateway of the inn. I introduced
them to the coach-office, where they took places for
the ensuing evening; and, as my night’s ride had
brought me to an appetite, I proposed (before
going to my mother’s, whose lodgings were close at
hand,) that we should breakfast together; to which
they assenting, I conducted them to the coffee-room,
and calling the waiter, ordered tea, coffee,
and plenty of muffins with all possible speed. We
had nearly concluded our meal, and I had just
bespoke a morning paper from the waiter, when
the room beginning to fill, several gentlemen entered,
and passed the table at which we sat, proceeding
to the upper end of the room. At that moment a
voice struck my ear, which almost petrified me
with fear and astonishment, for I felt persuaded at
the time that it was that of Mr. Oxley himself,
exclaiming, “Waiter, see that portmanteau of mine
brought in.” On hearing these words, I almost
dropped the tea-cup from my hand, and on the
impulse of the moment, quitted my seat, and hastily
left the room; nor did I stop for a moment’s reflection
until I had crossed Holborn, and found myself
at the corner of Gray’s-Inn-Lane. Then, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
conceiving I was out of danger, I endeavoured to
rally my spirits, and to persuade myself that I must
have been mistaken, as it was highly improbable
that Mr. Oxley, whom I had left on board the
Buffalo, should so suddenly have arrived in town,
and particularly at the White Horse, no Portsmouth
or Gosport coach setting up there. However, Mr.
Oxley’s voice and manner of speaking being a little
remarkable, I was so far in doubt that I determined
not to return. What opinion the countrymen must
form of me, I know not; it is likely they would
impute my unmannerly departure to a design of
avoiding payment of the reckoning. I have since
ascertained that I was mistaken in my conjecture,
for Mr. Oxley did not quit the ship until several
days afterwards.</p>

<p>I now repaired to Middle-Row, and inquiring
for my mother, was ushered up stairs, where I found
her and my two sisters pretty comfortably situated
in a genteel first floor, which they hired ready furnished.
They all expressed great joy at seeing me.
My mother appeared to be in a declining state, but
my sisters were much improved, and really very fine
girls. I understood that the whole family were
supported by the industry of the latter, who worked
incessantly at their needle, being excellent proficients
in fancy-work, which they obtained from
various shops. Having explained to my mother
the particulars of my situation, and the risk I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
incurred by my desertion; and recollecting that I
had inconsiderately suffered her letter, in which was
her address, to be seen by several persons on board
the Buffalo, it occurred to me that Captain Houston
might possibly come to the knowledge of that particular,
the consequence of which might be fatal to
me. It was the opinion of my mother, that I should
on that account, absent myself from town for a few
weeks, until the affair was blown over, and my
mother advised that I should go down to my relations
in S⸺shire. I accordingly the next day set
out by the coach, an aunt of mine who was in good
circumstances, supplying me with the needful. On
arriving at S⸺ I went to a public-house, which
was still kept by a woman who had known me
from my infancy; as I feared to break abruptly
on my aged grandfather, who might be too much
affected to sustain the surprise, I, therefore, got
the landlady to send word that a stranger had arrived,
who brought news from his grandson: having thus
prepared the way, I followed in person, and was
received with transport by my dear and venerable
benefactor. On inquiring into his circumstances,
I was grieved to learn that he had been for several
years obliged to subsist upon the charity of his
friends, and particularly the worthy family of the
Moultries, of whom I have made honourable mention
in the second chapter of these Memoirs. I
was also concerned to find that the dear old man’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
faculties were much impaired, and my grief was
heightened by the reflection that my misconduct
and consequent misfortunes had been the primary
cause of his mental as well as pecuniary distress.
My other relatives in S⸺ treated me with every
mark of attention, and I was hospitably entertained
by them all during my stay in that town. It is to
be observed, that only two or three of my nearest
relations were acquainted with the events of my
life for the last seven years. It was given out that
I had been abroad, but it was understood in a respectable
capacity. About a fortnight after my
arrival in S⸺shire, I received a letter from my
mother, informing me that no inquiry whatever had
been made respecting me, and concluding from
thence that I might with safety return when I
thought proper. As no prospect of employment
presented itself in the country, it was the opinion
of my friends that I should again try my fortune in
London; for which purpose they jointly supplied me
with money to defray my present expenses, and
contributed among them a few necessaries I was
most in need of. I was persuaded that my dear
grandfather would not experience the want of any
reasonable comforts during the short remaining
term of his life, which could not in all probability
be long protracted. I was, therefore, less solicitous
about continuing on the spot, as my presence in
fact only tended to recall to his half-distracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
mind the remembrance of former and better days.
My grandfather gave me letters of recommendation
to several of his old law acquaintances, particularly
one to a Mr. Belt, who held a superior situation in
the crown-office, and who had formerly been articled
to himself when resident in London.</p>

<p>All things being arranged, I once more took leave
of my friends, and set off by the coach for London,
on the 1st of January, 1808. Having occasion to
take a fresh coach at Birmingham, and wishing to
take a little recreation, which the restraint I was
under at S⸺, and the nature of the place had
hitherto precluded me from, and having the pecuniary
means of so doing in my power, I determined
on devoting a few days to that object, before I
resumed my journey to London. After three days’
amusement I again took coach, and having travelled
all night, we stopped about seven in the morning at
Henley-upon-Thames to breakfast. I had been so
free in my expenses at Birmingham, that I had at
this time but four shillings left in my purse. I
therefore declined alighting, in order to save the cost
of a breakfast, as I had had a snack at the last
stage, and felt no inclination to eat. The other
passengers having entered the house, I remained
alone in the coach, the horses being taken out, and
the coachman and guard having also quitted it.
After sitting a few minutes, it occurred to me that I
had seen a number of small parcels put into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
seats of the coach, previous to our departure from
Birmingham; and, having frequently heard of large
sums in bank-notes being transmitted by this mode
of conveyance to London, I was tempted to purloin
one of them, which it appeared I should run no
risk in doing, as the coast was clear, and I had a
large bundle of linen, <i>&amp;c.</i>, deposited in one of the
seats. I solemnly declare that until this moment,
no idea of depredation had entered my head since
my arrival in England; the act was, therefore, perfectly
unpremeditated. Without hesitation then,
I opened the seat, and taking out my bundle, untied
it, in case of a surprise. As I had not time to examine
the contents of the various parcels, I determined
to trust to fortune, and therefore took out
the first which came to hand. It was enclosed in
brown paper, tied with packthread, about twelve
inches by eight in size, and from its weight and
hardness, I supposed it to contain some kind of
cutlery or other hardware; but as such goods were
commonly packed up with bank-notes, to prevent
a suspicion of money being enclosed, the apparent
contents were a matter of indifference to me. The
parcel was directed to “Mr. ⸺, Goodge-street,
Tottenham-court-road.” This circumstance
convinced me there could be no discovery of the
robbery until after I was far enough from the coach,
which I intended to quit on arriving at the Gloucester
Coffee-house, as, in case I had gone on to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
George and Blue-boar in Holborn, the parcel might
possibly have been searched for, on our passing the
end of Tottenham-court-road. Having concealed
my prize in my own bundle, which I replaced in
the seat, I judged it best to alight and partake of
breakfast with the other passengers. I was also in
better spirits on account of the confidence I felt,
that I should find something in the parcel to recruit
my slender finances; as, let the contents be what
they might, it was probable they would produce
me at least a guinea or two, which would supply
my immediate exigencies. I accordingly entered
the parlour, and took a cup of coffee with the
company. The bill being called, amounted to two
shillings and three pence per head; I put down
half-a-crown, which left me in possession of
eighteen pence. We then re-ascended the coach,
and resumed our journey. At three in the afternoon
we entered London, and stopping as usual at the
Gloucester Coffee-house, I told the coachman I
should then leave him, as I resided in the neighbourhood.
He inquired if I had any luggage, and
on my saying I had a bundle in the seat, he
opened the door and handed it to me. I gratified
him with a shilling out of my small stock, and
made the best of my way. Having suffered the
coach to pass on, I followed slowly until I arrived
in Holborn; but previous to visiting my mother, I
entered a public-house, being anxious to examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
my newly-acquired prize. Retiring to a private
room, I cut the string with a trembling hand, and
opening the outside paper, found three several
parcels (also in brown paper,) lying one upon
another. Developing the first of these, I found
it to contain, to my no small surprise and chagrin,
a quantity of fine, new ⸺ twelvepenny nails!
about a hundred in number. My hopes now fell
to the ground. I was determined, however, to see
the whole; and lo! the second paper contained
⸺ the same quantity of tenpenny nails!! The
third and last, which I carelessly unfolded, expecting
nothing better, presented a number of small plated
articles, apparently designed for fixing on harness,
being hooks, rings, <i>&amp;c.</i>, of various shapes, and every
one separately wrapped in fine silver paper. As
these latter articles were of no more real value to
me than the nails, I was much mortified at my ill
luck, and was on the point of tying up the whole
parcel in order to throw it away as soon as I gained
the street, when it fortunately struck me that there
must be somewhere, a letter or note accompanying
these goods. I, therefore, once more overhauled
the packages, and lifting up the bottom one, found
under it a letter, which on taking up, I perceived to
contain an enclosure, and I plainly felt several
pieces of loose money. Now again my spirits
rose—all that I had read and heard of large sums
in bank-notes being artfully transmitted in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
manner, recurred to my mind, and I eagerly drew
the candle towards me, half afraid, and yet impatient
to see the event. The letter was superscribed in
the same manner as the parcel; and opening it,
I could scarce believe my eyes, when I discovered
some bank-paper carefully folded, and through
which the black marks of the sum were plainly
discernible! Before I ascertained the amount,
however, I proceeded to peruse the letter, and found
it to the following effect:—“Sir, I have sent you
herewith specimens of the nails and other articles;
the order shall be completed as speedily as possible.
I have also enclosed you £47 9<i>s.</i> which you will find
to be the present balance between us. I am, <i>&amp;c.</i>”—Here
was an unexpected windfall! The reader
will conceive my joy, and with what satisfaction
I replaced the parcel in my bundle, in order to quit
the public-house. The notes proved to be two of
twenty pounds each on a Birmingham bank, but
payable also at Forster, Lubbock, and Co’s, in
London, a bank of England five pound note, and
another of two pounds, also a bank dollar, and four
shillings. I now repaired with a light heart to my
mother’s lodgings, where I met with a cordial welcome.
Having spent the evening with my mother,
I walked into the city and procured a bed at an inn.
The next morning I sent one of my twenty pound
notes by a porter to the banking-house, where he
procured small notes of the Bank of England in<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
exchange; I soon afterwards called myself with the
second, and did the like. Being now possessed of
near fifty pounds by this lucky hit, I determined to
furnish myself with a stock of genteel clothes, a
watch, and other appendages, prior to my obtaining
some employment, as I always considered an outward
appearance essential to success in every pursuit;
but I was firmly resolved never again to hazard
my liberty by a second act or attempt of a similar
nature.</p>

<p>In a few days I had purchased such articles as
were most requisite, at the expense of about forty
pounds, and I then turned my attention to procuring
a genteel situation. I accordingly waited on Mr.
Belt, the gentleman I mentioned of the Crown-office;
who, on perusal of the letter I presented,
testified his respect for my grandfather’s recommendation,
and very obligingly offered to take me as an
assistant clerk under his own direction in the above
office, if I thought fit to accept of a guinea a week,
which was all he could promise to allow me at first,
but might be afterwards increased. I thought this
too favourable an offer to be rejected. I, therefore,
thankfully closed with it, and prepared immediately
to attend assiduously to the duties of my office.</p>

</div>

<p>I had, on my second arrival in London, engaged
a small apartment in a creditable house, and regulated
my expenses upon principles of the strictest
economy; but notwithstanding every possible effort,
I soon found it impossible to subsist within my income;
consequently, in a few weeks I had sensibly
decreased my little capital. I, therefore, began to
consider how I might obtain a more productive
situation, as I saw no prospect of my present salary
being augmented. At this juncture I met with an
advertisement for a person of good education, to act
as Reader in a Printing Office. Though this was an
employment of which I had not the least idea, I determined
to offer myself, conceiving there could be
nothing very difficult in its duties. Having, therefore,
first inquired into the nature of the latter I
boldly applied to the advertiser Mr. Barnard, on
Snow-hill; and in answer to his queries, replied that
I had lately left the service of a country printer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
whom I named, and was well acquainted with the
business of a printing office in general; adding, that
if he pleased to make trial of me, I doubted not of
proving well qualified for the situation in question.
Mr. Barnard consented to do so; and informing me
that the salary he had given my predecessor was two
guineas a week, expressed his willingness to allow
me the same. I was so much pleased with this increase
of wages, as well as with the nature of the
employment when explained to me, that I immediately
quitted Mr. Belt, and began my attendance
at the office of Mr. Barnard. My business here
was to read over or examine the proofs (sheet by
sheet, as they were struck off by the pressmen) of
every new work printed by my employer. These
proofs or first impressions, having been first compared
with the copy or manuscript, the errors so
discovered being noted by me, were corrected by
the compositor, and a second impression produced,
which was then carefully examined, and the few
errors yet remaining were rectified as before. A
third sheet was then revised by me, which in most
cases proved perfectly correct; and this being ascertained,
the required number of copies were struck
off, whilst a succeeding sheet was in the hands
of the compositors, in a state of progress for the
like operation. In a few days I had a perfect knowledge
of the business confided to me; and here I
found the advantages of a good education, and of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
extensive reading, which enabled me at first sight
to detect many errors that an experienced “Reader,”
with a common education, would have passed over,
particularly where Latin or French phrases, quotations,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, were introduced. This soon became obvious
to my employer, who expressed his satisfaction,
and paid me more than common respect. On
my part I was equally pleased with my new situation.
The business of Mr. Barnard’s office was
very extensive. It employed from forty to fifty
workmen in various capacities, and he had generally
ten or more different works (periodical as well
as others) in the press. Among these were some of
an entertaining kind; so that while I was performing
my duty, I gratified my passion for reading, and
anticipated the public in the perusal of many curious
and interesting new publications.</p>

<p>I still adhered closely to my system of economy
and took care to expend something less than my income.
It was my fixed determination to abstain
from every kind of dishonesty; and for about three
weeks I met with no temptation to an opposite conduct:
but one day as I entered the eating-house at
which I commonly dined, I was accosted by a young
man who had come home with me from New South
Wales, in the Buffalo, having been for several years in
the service of Governor King. This was, in fact, the
very person to whom I had confided my intention of deserting,
and bequeathed my effects previous to my going<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
ashore. Our joy at meeting was reciprocal, and
before we parted an appointment to sup together the
same evening was the consequence. My old friend
informed me that the Buffalo was paid in about five
days after I quitted her, and that the crew were immediately
drafted into various ships: he himself was put
on board the Diomede of 50, and having at last,
with much difficulty, obtained a liberty-ticket for
eight days, he had been about a week in town. It
is needless to add, that nothing was further from his
thoughts than returning. From him I also learnt
that a diligent search was instituted for me in Portsmouth
the day after my absconding, and that Captain
King, as well as his subordinate Captain Houston,
were much exasperated on the occasion. On meeting
my shipmate at the appointed place (which by-the-by,
proved to be a house of ill repute) he introduced
me to several other old acquaintances, who
had also come home with us, and to a few of the
same stamp, who had been a longer time returned,
from New South Wales. I soon discovered that
they had all resumed the same depredatory course
of life which had caused their former sufferings,
and must inevitably entail upon them future misery
and disgrace. However, as I knew how fruitless
it would be to advise or remonstrate, I contented
myself with letting them know that I had met with
a tolerable situation which enabled me to live <i>upon
the square</i>, and that I had “<i>tied up prigging</i>,” as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
I was determined never to be “<i>lagged</i>” again<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. By
this communication I only incurred at the moment,
a few dry jokes on my pretended honesty, and a hint
or two that I should soon become tired of servitude,
and be easily brought over to get an easy guinea.
Upon the whole, I spent a very agreeable evening,
but to prevent a relapse, I determined to avoid the
company of these misguided persons in future, notwithstanding
they extracted a promise at parting,
that I would meet them again next day. This promise
I scrupled not to break, and how long I might have
refrained from their society I know not; but a day
or two afterwards, as I was descending Holborn-hill
in my way to the office, I unexpectedly met
my old partner and fellow-sufferer, Alexander
Bromley, whom I had left in Newgate in 1801.
Having in vain made inquiry as to his fate, since
my return to England, I was truly glad to see him,
for he looked well and was genteelly dressed. I was
so much altered, that when I first accosted him, he
had no immediate recollection of me, but on making
myself known, nothing could exceed the joy he
evinced at our meeting. Before we parted it was
indispensable that we should drink together, and he
hastily informed me that he had served his seven
years on board the Hulks, at Portsmouth, from
whence he returned to London the 17th of September<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
1807, and that he was now once more under
the protection of his father, who had received him
with great kindness, and was inclined, if he continued
honest, to take care of his future fortune;
but added, with a shrewd shake of the head, that
he could never reconcile himself to confinement on
a shop-board, and feared he should very speedily
make a push at some higher enjoyments. Having
agreed to dine together, and by mere accident named
the house at which I had lately supped as the place
of meeting, we parted with some little regret.</p>

<p>Bromley was punctual to his time, and during the
two hours I allowed for dinner, we became more
fully informed of each other’s circumstances. When
I was on the point of leaving him to return to my
duty, two or three of my Botany-bay acquaintances
dropping in, forcibly detained me; urging that I might
for once stretch a point, and spend the afternoon with
them, ridiculing with too much effect, the idea of
a man like myself being confined to certain hours
like a school-boy, <i>&amp;c.</i> As I was somewhat elevated
with the liquor I had drank, and had really no
business at the office which could not be easily deferred,
I consented in an evil moment, to join the
party which was forming, consisting of nearly a
dozen persons, most of them recently returned either
from the Hulks, or New South Wales. It is needless
to describe the nature of our conversation, or
the various characters of which the party was composed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
let it suffice to state (with sorrow and shame
I confess it) that I was effectually laughed out of my
late good intentions; and before we parted, had joined
with the loudest of them in decrying and contemning
every species of servitude or confinement; and
cordially agreed in a resolution to live independent
while I could, and to make up by every means in
my power for the privations and sufferings I had
endured for the last seven years.</p>

<p>From this moment I returned no more to the
printing-office, but joined myself with Bromley, and
a few others, who regularly walked out every evening
in quest of money, without confining our pursuits
to any particular branch, but embracing every
opportunity which offered. These were indeed but
few, and far from productive, so that I soon grew
heartily tired of the set I was associated with, and
determined to withdraw myself from them the first
opportunity, and to live by the exercise of my own
ingenuity. Indeed my appearance was so much
above, and of so different a stamp from their’s, that
this circumstance alone was enough to excite suspicion,
and on many accounts rendered them unsuitable
companions for me. I determined, however,
not to discard poor Bromley, for whom I felt a
real friendship, on account of our former intimacy
and joint misfortunes.</p>

</div>

<p>Having withdrawn myself from my late companions,
I now became very circumspect in my
proceedings; and as Bromley had neither the appearance
nor the manners of a gentleman, I only
made use of him occasionally in the course of my
practice, keeping him in the back ground to receive
and carry any articles which I purloined, and never
suffering him to converse with, or approach me
except in private. I generally spent the mornings,
that is, from about one o’clock to five P. M. (which
are the fashionable hours for shopping) in visiting
the shops of Jewellers, Watchmakers, Pawnbrokers,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Having conceived hopes that this species of
robbery would turn to a good account, and depending
upon my own address and appearance, I determined
to make a circuit of the town, and not to
omit a single shop in either of those branches: and
this scheme I actually executed so fully, that I believe
I did not leave ten untried in all London, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
I made a point of commencing every day in a certain
street and went regularly through it on both
sides the way. My practice was to enter a shop
and request to look at gold seals, chains, broaches,
rings, or any other small articles of value; and while
examining them, and looking the shopkeeper in the
face, I contrived by slight of hand to conceal two
or three (sometimes more) in the sleeve of my coat,
which was purposely made wide. On some occasions
I purchased a trifling article to save appearances;
at other times I took a card of the shop,
promising to call again; and as I generally saw the
remaining goods returned to the window, or place
from whence they were taken, before I left the shop,
there was hardly a probability of my being suspected,
or of the property being missed. In the course
of my career I was never once detected in the fact,
though on two or three occasions, so much suspicion
arose, that I was obliged to exert all my
effrontery, and to use very high language, in
order, as the cant phrase is, to <i>bounce</i> the tradesman
<i>out of it</i>; and my fashionable appearance, and affected
anger at his insinuations, had always the
effect of convincing him that he was mistaken, and
inducing him to apologize for the affront put upon
me. I have even sometimes carried away the spoil
notwithstanding what had passed, and I have often
gone a second and third time to the same shop,
with as good success as at the first. To prevent accidents<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
however, I made it a rule never to enter a
second shop with any stolen property about me;
for as soon as I quitted the first, I privately conveyed
my booty to Bromley, who was attending my
motions in the street, and herein I found him eminently
useful. By this course of depredation I acquired
on the average about ten pounds a week,
though I sometimes neglected shopping for several
days together. This was not, indeed, the only pursuit
I followed, but was my principal morning’s
occupation; though if a favourable opportunity
offered of getting a guinea by any other means, I
never let it slip. In the evenings I generally attended
one of the theatres, where I mixed with the
best company in the boxes, and at the same time
that I enjoyed the amusements of the place, I frequently
conveyed pocket-books, snuff-boxes, and
other portable articles, from the pockets of their
proprietors into my own. Here I found the inconvenience
of wanting a suitable companion, who
might have received the articles I made prize of,
in the same manner as Bromley did in the streets;
but though I knew many of the light-fingered gentry,
whose appearance fitted them for any company, yet,
their faces being well known to the police-officers,
who attend the Theatres, they would not have been
suffered to enter the house: and herein I possessed
an advantage which many of these gentry envied me;
for being just arrived in England, and a new face<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
upon the town, I carried on my depredations under
the very noses of the officers, without suspicion.
Having, therefore, at first no associate, I was obliged
to quit the Theatre and conceal my first booty in
some private spot, before I could make (with prudence)
a second attempt. Upon the whole I was
very successful in this pursuit also, at least as to
the <i>number</i> of articles I filched, and had their <i>value</i>
been reasonably proportionate to what I expected, I
need not long have followed so hazardous an employment.
I have very frequently obtained nine or
ten pocket-books, besides other articles, in an evening;
and these being taken from gentlemen evidently
of fortune and fashion, I had reason to expect I
should sometime meet with a handsome sum in
Bank-notes; but fortune did not favour me therein,
for during near twelve months almost nightly attendance
at one or other of the public places, I
never found more than twenty pounds in a book,
and that only on one occasion. I several times got
five, ten, or eleven pounds, but commonly one, two,
or three pounds, and most generally four books out
of five contained nothing but letters, memorandums,
and other papers useless to me. At the same time
I knew frequent instances of the common street
pickpockets getting a booty of fifty, one hundred and
sometimes three or four hundred pounds. However,
I never failed to pay the expenses of the night,
and if I gained nothing, I enjoyed at least a fund<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of amusement, which was to me the highest gratification.
It sometimes happened that the articles I
got (particularly pocket-books) were advertised by the
losers, within a few days, as “Lost,” and a reward
offered for their restoration: where this reward was
worth notice, I frequently restored the property by
means of a third person whom I could confide in,
and whom I previously tutored for the purpose.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the manner in which I spent my
life, abstracted from the disgraceful means by which I
supported myself, was (as I have formerly hinted,)
perfectly regular and inoffensive. Though I lived
by depredation, yet I did not like the abandoned
class of common thieves, waste my money, and
leisure time in profligate debauchery, but applied
myself to the perusal of instructive and amusing
books, my stock of which I daily increased. I occupied
genteel apartments in a creditable house,
the landlord of which understood me to hold a situation
under Government, and every part of my conduct
at home tended to confirm his opinion of my
respectability. I was scrupulously exact in paying
my rent, as well as the different tradesmen in the
neighbourhood, with whom I had occasion to deal;
nor did I ever suffer any person of loose character
to visit me, but studiously concealed from those of my
acquaintance my place of residence. I was sometimes,
indeed, so imprudent as to resort, for company’s
sake, to some of those public-houses frequented<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
by thieves and other dissolute characters, the
landlord of which is himself commonly an experienced
thief, or returned transport. When I had
a mind to relax a little, or grew tired of domestication,
I disguised my appearance as much as I could,
and repaired to a house of this description, sometimes
taking my Dulcinea with me, whom I shall shortly
introduce to the reader, and whose person and dress
I was not a little proud of exhibiting in public.
This fondness for flash-houses, as they are termed,
is the rock on which most persons who live by depredation
unhappily split, and will be found in the
sequel to have brought me to my present deplorable
condition; for the police officers, or traps, are in
the daily habit of visiting these houses, where they
drink with the thieves, <i>&amp;c.</i>, in the most familiar
manner; and, I believe, often obtain secret information
by various means from some parties respecting
the names, characters, pursuits, <i>&amp;c.</i>, of others.
By this imprudent conduct I also became personally
known to many of the officers, which was productive
of great danger to me in the exercise of my vocation;
whereas, had I avoided such houses, I might
have remained unknown and unsuspected by them
for a series of years. I ought not to omit what may
perhaps gratify the reader, as much as the act did myself,
namely, that as soon as I became possessed of a
moderate sum, I remembered the kindness shewn
me by the good woman at Gosport, and wrote her<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
a letter of thanks, enclosing a five-pound bank-note,
which, no doubt, proved highly acceptable. I also
from time to time assisted my aged mother, whose
circumstances were extremely narrow, and her support
derived solely from the earnings of my two sisters,
whose success depending on the caprice of fashion
and of milliners, both alike inconstant, was but precarious.
They, as well as my other relations in
S⸺shire, were indeed totally ignorant of my unhappy
relapse into a life of infamy, but believed my
assertion, that I had a liberal salary from Mr. Belt,
and was still employed under that gentleman in the
Crown-office.</p>

<p>About three months after my return to London,
and whilst in the zenith of my success, I was introduced
by one of my former dissolute companions
to the acquaintance of a young woman, who, like
myself, had been well and tenderly brought up,
but having been seduced by a young man equally
inexperienced with herself, to quit her friends and cohabit
with him as his wife, she had thereby forfeited
the countenance of her family, and her paramour
having died after a year’s cohabitation, she had been
driven to the usual refuge in such cases, a life of
prostitution. At the period of my introduction,
however, she had been only a few months upon the
town, and I clearly perceived that her mind was yet
but very slightly contaminated. As there were many
reasons which rendered a female companion in whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
I could place confidence, desirable, and in fact
necessary to me; and as this young woman’s misfortunes
had placed her in such circumstances, that
I had no obstacles to surmount on the score of delicacy,
I proposed to her, after a few days’ acquaintance,
that we should live together; to which, as she
was heartily tired of her present course of life, she
willingly consented. She knew enough of the world
from her late experience, to surmise in what manner
I obtained my living, of which, however, to avoid
all duplicity, I fully possessed her. Having informed
my landlord, that my wife, whom I had not before
mentioned to him, was arrived in town from a visit
she had been paying in the country, I accordingly took
her home; and in a very few days we had arranged
a pretty snug system of domestic economy, and provided
every requisite for the family life I meant in
future to live. My companion was the daughter of
an industrious mechanic, who, having a numerous
offspring, had only been enabled to give her a common
education; but her mother had instructed her
in the duties of house-keeping, and she was perfectly
conversant in all the qualities requisite to form a
good wife. She was about nineteen years of age,
agreeable in her person, and of the sweetest disposition
imaginable; and what was most gratifying,
the company she had latterly mixed with, and the
disgusting examples before her eyes, had not been
able to eradicate an innate modesty which she naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
possessed; so that her manners and conversation
were such as fitted her for any company to which
I might be inclined to introduce her. I informed
my mother and sisters that I was on the point of
contracting a union with this young woman, and
having made them personally acquainted, the
three young ladies soon became very intimate. As
my mother and sisters but rarely called at my lodgings,
and then merely <i>en passant</i>, I had no difficulty
in concealing the connexion from them until I could
with propriety declare my marriage to have taken
place. We had the happiness of finding ourselves
mutually pleased with each other, and I considered
my meeting with so amiable a friend as one of the
greatest blessings of my life. In a few weeks after
our junction, my partner discovered evident symptoms
of pregnancy, which with her affectionate behaviour,
and real attachment to my interest, endeared
her still more to me. In a word, I now felt myself
as happy as any man daily risking his liberty
and life, and exposed to the reproaches of his own
conscience, could possibly be.</p>

</div>

<p>Having now settled myself in a manner much
to my satisfaction, and happily met with a faithful
friend, to whom I might confide my most secret
thoughts, who would sincerely participate my joy,
when success crowned my pursuits; and who, in
the hour of adversity, would condole with, and
cherish me, I applied myself with redoubled assiduity
to the acquirement of money, with a full resolution
in the event of my meeting with one good
booty, or realizing by degrees a sufficient sum to quit
the hazardous course of life I had embarked in, to
establish myself in some honest line of business. To
this prudent measure I was also strongly prompted
by my companion, who could not hide her fears and
anxiety on my account, and was never easy during
my absence from home on a depredatory excursion.
I continued to visit the shops as usual in the morning,
and the theatres in the evening with tolerable
success; and my partner having expressed a desire
to accompany me, in the hope of rendering me service,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
I was induced to gratify her. As her figure
and address were both extremely prepossessing, and
her air perfectly genteel, I soon found her eminently
useful; for she not only received from me the property
I purloined, but with much ingenuity would
contrive to engross the attention of the shopkeeper
while I robbed his counter, or by artful gallanting
with a gentleman at a public place, facilitate my
design upon his pockets. At all times, when disengaged
from these hazardous practices, we lived
a life of perfect domestic happiness, our chiefest
pleasure being centred in each other’s company.</p>

<p>As our mutual affection increased, my companion,
whom I had informed of the outlines of my past
life, and who was aware of the dangers to which I
was daily exposed, being filled with tender fears
of losing me for ever, and prompted by sincere affection,
suggested the idea of uniting ourselves indissolubly
by marriage; in the hope that should
I unhappily experience a reverse of fortune, and
be again banished from my native country, she might
obtain permission to share my misery, and contribute,
by her society, to lessen my sufferings. This
proposal so fully convinced me of her undisguised
attachment, and had so much reason on its side,
that I gave into it with ardent pleasure; and the
necessary preliminaries being adjusted, we were accordingly
married at St. Paul’s, Covent-Garden, on
the 21st of July, 1808, her mother, to whom she<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
had become reconciled, and who (judging by appearances,)
had a favourable opinion of the match,
assisting at the ceremony.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, I communicated the event to
my mother, informing her that weighty reasons had
rendered it necessary to observe privacy on the occasion;
and hinting to the unsuspecting old woman,
that I had acquired by this marriage, a considerable
pecuniary advantage. This intimation gave my
mother great pleasure, and I took care by increased
liberality towards her and my sisters, to confirm
them in the opinion of my veracity. The behaviour
of my wife became every day more exemplary; and
had I been free from that remorse which must ever
accompany a guilty life, and enabled to procure
those necessary comforts which I knew so well how
to enjoy, by upright means, I should have considered
myself supremely happy. In the beginning of
the month of October, my wife, who was far advanced
in her pregnancy, accompanied me one evening
to Drury-lane theatre; and the performance being
over, we were descending the stair-case from the box-lobby,
when I attempted to possess myself of a gentleman’s
pocket-book; but by some accident he suspected
my design, and publicly accused me therewith.
Unfortunately several other gentlemen, who
had been robbed in the course of the evening, being
on the spot, and beginning to compare notes, agreed
unanimously that they recollected my person as<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
being near them about the time they were robbed,
and did not scruple to insinuate that I ought to be
detained and searched. This conversation naturally
attracted the attention of the company immediately
round us; but while it took place, all the
parties were obliged by the pressure of the throng
behind to continue descending, and we in fact quitted
the theatre all together. Being arrived in Little
Russell-street, the gentlemen surrounded me to the
number of about a score, and our altercation became
loud and vehement. Fortunately for me no
police-officers happened to be near the spot; for
although I had nothing to fear from a search, yet
the circumstance would have made me personally
known to the latter, and would of course operate to
my disadvantage on my future appearance at the
theatre. I exerted every art of expostulation, and
finally had recourse, on my part, to threats, affecting
to feel highly insulted by their insolent insinuations;
declared myself a gentleman of character, which I
would prove to their cost; offered to give my card
of address, or to retire to a coffee-house, and send
for respectable persons who knew me, but all my
rhetoric proved ineffectual; some were for giving
me in charge to an officer; others still more violent
were for having me pumped. At this moment a
person named G—ge W—k—n, now in this colony,
who had been himself exercising his vocation in the
pit of the theatre, happened fortunately to come up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and seeing a crowd collected, stopped to ascertain
the cause. He immediately perceived the critical
situation in which I stood, and having the appearance
of a man of fashion, he stepped forward, and
hearing the various motions of my persecutors,
strongly advised them to forbearance, and caution
how they treated a gentleman, as I evidently appeared
to be; urging that they must certainly be mistaken
in their conjectures, that my proposal of
giving my address, or a reference, ought to be sufficient,
and particularly dwelt on the impropriety of
taking the law into their own hands. These arguments
of my friend W—k—n carried so much
weight, that the gentlemen began to waver and grow
less clamorous; till at length they dropped off one
by one; and W—k—n, assuming a haughty tone,
said, taking me by the arm, “Come, Sir, you have
been sufficiently exposed, and long enough detained
on a charge which I am confident there is no foundation
for; allow me to conduct you from this spot;
if you are going towards St. James’s, I shall be glad
of your company, and let me see (raising his voice
and cane together,) who will dare to insult you
further.” So saying, he led me away in triumph,
tipping the wink to my poor wife, who had stood
all the while at a small distance, much terrified and
agitated by various emotions, which so much affected
her, that though we lived within two hundred
yards of the theatre, she had scarcely power to walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
home; and we had no sooner quitted our kind conductor,
who attended us to the door, than she fainted
away, and was for sometime insensible. The
consequences of this untoward event were still more
seriously afflicting, for her tender constitution was
not proof against the shock, and she was the next
day prematurely delivered of a male child, which,
however, only lived eight hours, and was a subject
of infinite regret to us both.</p>

<p><i>Adventure of the Silver Snuff-box.—Its Consequences.—My

</div>

<p>Happening soon after the adventure at
Drury-lane, to read an advertisement, stating that
a meeting of the freeholders of the county of Middlesex
would be convened on the 11th of November,
at the Mermaid Tavern, Hackney, to consider
of the expediency of petitioning the Throne on the
subject of parliamentary reform, it struck me that
I might find it worth while to attend this meeting,
as it would probably attract a large concourse
of people, and, as at such assemblies riots and
much confusion frequently occurred, which afforded
a favourable opportunity for plundering the pockets
of the company. On the day appointed, I accordingly
left town in one of the Hackney stages, and
arriving at the Mermaid about one o’clock, found
the sheriffs had just opened the business of the
meeting, which was held in a large room commonly
used as an assembly-room for dancing, and detached
from the tavern itself. To my disappointment,
however, there were not above three hundred
persons collected, and the building being very<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
spacious, there was not the least prospect of any
violent pressure taking place. Before I commenced
my operations, I entered a small house
called “The Tap,” immediately contiguous to, but
distinct from, the Mermaid; and going into a parlour,
called to the landlady, a decent looking elderly
woman, for a glass of brandy and water, and a pipe.
Having taken and paid for this refreshment, I proceeded
to the meeting; and found, so far from any
tumult or uproar, that the whole company were
collected at one end of the room, and listening in
profound silence to the speech of some popular
and patriotic orator, who was warmly censuring
the conduct of ministers, and advocating the cause
of liberty. I now entered the thickest part of the
crowd, and having tried the pockets of a great many
persons without feeling a single pocket-book, I at
length extracted successively two snuff-boxes from
different gentlemen; but their coats being buttoned
up, and the pockets inside, I was obliged to use
my scissors in cutting the bottom of each pocket,
before I could obtain the desired prizes. This
trouble and risk I should not have incurred had not
I assured myself that the boxes from their shape, <i>&amp;c.</i>;
were both silver; but to my mortification, they
proved on inspection, the one wood, and the other
a sort of japanned leather, though both perfectly
genteel, and mounted with silver: however, as they
were of no intrinsic value to me, I threw them<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
away; and, although it was rather imprudent, I
entered the room a third time, in hopes of better
success. I soon found myself standing behind a
well-dressed man, who was wrapped in deep attention
to the speaker, and perceived to my great joy
that he had a small leather pocket-book in his
inside coat-pocket, and also a very fine large snuff-box,
evidently silver, from its shape and weight. I
had again recourse to my scissors, and having made
an incision, extracted the contents of the pocket,
with which I hastily retired: but I was again partially
disappointed, for I found that what I had taken
for a pocket-book, was in fact merely a pen and
ink-case: the box, however, was a very elegant one,
and quite new. Although it appeared that I was
not destined to be very fortunate in this day’s adventure,
I determined to make one other trial; but
as it would be dangerous to keep the stolen box
about me, and I saw no convenient spot in which
to conceal it, I adopted the following method to
dispose of it, while I made my final attempt in the
assembly-room. Going into the little tap-house
before described, I addressed the landlady, inquiring
if she sold any snuff, or could without inconvenience,
procure me a little. She answered that
she had none, but would get me some in a very
short time. I thanked her, and replied that as I
was anxious to hear the debates in the assembly-room,
she would oblige me by procuring an ounce<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
of rappee, for which purpose I handed her the box
I had just obtained, saying I would call for it in
a quarter of an hour. Having now, as I conceived,
effectually and safely deposited my prize, I left the
Tap with an intention of re-entering the meeting-room;
but suddenly changing my mind, I determined
to desist, having by the box alone secured
the expenses of my journey, and to return immediately
home. However, as I felt hungry, and saw
no signs of accommodation for eating in the Tap,
I proceeded a little way up the street, till I came
to a sort of cook’s-shop, where I procured a lunch,
and then returned to reclaim my snuff-box from my
obliging old landlady, having been absent from her
barely a quarter of an hour. Going boldly up to
the little bar in which she sat, I inquired if she had
procured me the snuff; she replied that she had,
and turning round to a cupboard behind her, produced
the box, which I held out my hand to receive;
but, to my utter confusion, I was prevented
by the gentleman himself, from whom I had stolen
it, who, starting from a dark corner of the passage
close to my elbow, where he had been concealed,
received the box in his hand, and turning to me,
inquired in a peremptory tone, if that was my
snuff-box? I answered with a smile, “No, Sir, it
is a box that I found—if you have any claim to it,
it is much at your service.” He then inquired
where I had found it; I replied, that going to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
water in a corner of the stable-yard, I perceived
something shine amongst some rubbish, which
taking up, I found to be the box in question; that
I was myself in the habit of taking snuff, and having
that day left my own box at home, I thought it a
good opportunity of getting a supply; that I had
therefore commissioned the landlady to procure me
some snuff, and left her this box for that purpose.
The gentleman rejoined, that he had been robbed
of the box in the assembly-room, and that having
found it in my possession, he felt it incumbent to
detain me, on strong suspicion of being the thief.
All I could urge, and every art I tried, were ineffectual
to convince this rigid gentleman of my innocence,
and several others joining him, one of them
asked my name and situation in life. I answered,
that when charged with so disgraceful an act as
that of picking pockets, I should certainly decline
giving such explanation; but that I should at a
proper season, be enabled to refute the accusation,
and prove my respectability. To this the inquirer
replied, that although himself a justice of peace,
he certainly had no wish to extort, nor was I obliged
to give any answers against my inclination, and
that upon the whole, he could not censure me for
preserving silence; however, as the property stolen
had been traced to me, it became his duty and that
of the owner, to have me detained till I gave an
account of myself. A constable being called in,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
was now desired to search me, which he proceeded
to do, and the first thing he found was a pair of
small scissors without a sheath, in my breeches-pocket,
where I had in my hurry deposited them
after cutting out my last booty. The constable
exhibited these with an air of triumph, exclaiming
to the by-standers, “See, gentlemen, here are the
tools the pocket was cut with!” He also took
from me about fifty shillings in loose money, a
pocket-bock, card-case, pair of silver spectacles, a
two-bladed knife, silver pencil-case, tobacco-box,
handkerchief, gloves, <i>&amp;c.</i>, all my own property,
and such as I usually carried about me. I had
left my watch at home, which, it being a valuable
one, I was frequently persuaded by my wife to do
when I went upon such excursions as the present.
The meeting being by this time dissolved, the loser
of the box set off on his return to town, and I was
left in charge of two constables who were to follow
with me. In about an hour, a coach being obtained,
I was conveyed to Worship-street office for examination,
where I arrived at six in the evening,
just as the magistrate had taken the chair. This
worshipful justice was Joseph Moser, esq., a gentleman
of an eccentric character, and the same, if
I mistake not, whose name I have frequently met
with in print, as the author of many well-written
and humorous essays, <i>&amp;c.</i>, in periodical works.
Being placed at the bar, the prosecutor, who proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to be a Mr. Imeson, tobacconist, in Holywell-lane,
Shoreditch, made his appearance in the same coat
he had on in the morning, and exhibiting his pocket,
through the bottom of which he thrust his hand by
way of demonstration. He stated, that he was that
day attending the meeting of freeholders at Hackney,
and while listening to the debates in the assembly-room,
he had occasion to take snuff; when putting his
hand in his pocket, he found the bottom of it cut,
apparently with a sharp scissors, and not only his
snuff-box, but every other article taken out; that
he was sure the depredation was recent, as he had
taken snuff but a few minutes before, and had not
since changed his position: that he staid to hear
the conclusion of the business, and on leaving the
room, was relating his loss to some gentlemen in
the inn-yard, and that a little boy happening to
overhear him, stepped up and said, “Sir, my
mother has got a pretty snuff-box, that a gentleman
gave her to put some snuff in;” on which he was
induced to accompany the child to its parents,
where, requesting to see the box, he found it to be
his own; that he had then taken the measures for
my detection, which I have above related. The
landlady, Mrs. Andrews, was then sworn, and stated
my coming to her house, taking some refreshment,
and afterwards returning to inquire for snuff, leaving
her the box, <i>&amp;c.</i>, all which, she said was transacted
in the most public manner; and, the good woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
voluntarily added, that she could never suppose I
should have acted as I had done, had I been the
person who stole the box. The officer who had
searched me, now produced the articles taken from
my person, not forgetting to dwell upon the circumstance
of the open scissors, the sheath of which
he found in another pocket. The magistrate viewing
these articles with attention, observed, that he
had no doubt of their being all stolen, and ordered
them to be advertised in the daily papers, and that
I should be brought up again on that day week,
when it was probable the persons who had lost such
articles, would attend to identify them. As to the
present charge, he said the case was clear enough,
and he would, to save further trouble, bind over
the parties to prosecute at once. Then addressing
me, his worship inquired my name, place of abode,
<i>&amp;c.</i> I answered, that my name was James Hardy,
but I must beg to decline giving any further account
of myself, as it appeared his worship was
determined to commit me for trial, and I should
therefore not trouble my friends until a future day.
Mr. Moser now remarked on some of the articles
found upon me, inquiring with a sarcastic grin, how
long I had worn barnacles? As to the knife, he
said it was evidently a thief’s knife; and turning to
Armstrong, one of his officers, he asked him, if
that was not such a blade as they used for <i>starring
a glaze</i>? The knife and scissors, his worship called<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
my working-tools. It was in vain I assured this
facetious justice that these things were my own
lawful property, and offered to prove where I had
purchased them all: he insisted on detaining them,
and was hardly persuaded to return the money
taken from me. I was then committed to New
Prison, Clerkenwell, to which I was conveyed
about nine o’clock at night. Arriving there, I
desired to be accommodated between-gates, and
after paying the usual fees, <i>&amp;c.</i>, I was conducted to
a bed in the same room I had occupied on a like
occasion, in the year 1800. Having now leisure to
reflect on the occurrences of the day, I began to consider
my situation hopeless enough; the snuff-box
having been traced to me, the circumstance of the
pocket being cut, the scissors found, <i>&amp;c.</i>, altogether
furnished a chain of evidence, too strong, I feared,
to be overruled by my bare assertion, that I had
found the property; a defence the most flimsy, but
the most commonly resorted to. I, therefore, laid
my account with being transported at least. What
heightened my present distress was, that my poor wife
would be grievously alarmed at my not returning
home this night; and it would be a difficult matter,
even the next day, to inform her of my situation, as
I knew the officers were intent upon discovering,
if possible, my place of abode, in order to ascertain
my character, and mode of life. The morning
being come, I was fortunate enough to meet with<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
an intimate acquaintance, by whom I despatched a
message to my wife, requiring her to visit me immediately,
and in an hour’s time, I had the pleasure
of seeing her appear. Her distress may be easily
conceived. I comforted and encouraged her as
well as I could; and giving her a strict caution not
to suffer herself to be followed or watched in her
return, desired she would wait with patience, and
hope for the approach of the session, which would
decide my fate. During the interval of my second
examination, I read the following advertisement
inserted by the officers of Worship-street:—“Stopped
upon a suspicious person now in custody, the
undermentioned articles, supposed to be stolen;
[here they were all minutely described.] Any
persons having lost such goods, are desired to
attend at this office on Friday next, when the said
person will be brought up for re-examination, <i>&amp;c.</i>”
On the 18th of November, I was accordingly reconducted
to Worship-street, my wife being permitted
to accompany me in the coach. Being
again brought before Mr. Moser, that gentleman
inquired if any body was in attendance to claim the
property found on me; and being answered in the
negative, he expressed himself confident that claimants
would appear, but said he would, however,
finally commit me to Newgate, and, that the articles
in question should be detained until the day
of my trial; when, if not owned before, the court<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
would no doubt restore them on my application;
nor could all my asseverations or arguments convince
him of the property being my own, or induce
him to alter his decree respecting them. I was
accordingly conducted to Newgate, accompanied
by my wife, whose uniform attention to me in this
and every other distress, proved the sincerity of her
attachment.</p>

<p>As the session was to commence on the 30th, I
had no time to lose in preparing for my trial. I,
therefore, drew up a brief for counsel, in which I
dwelt strongly on the open and public manner in
which I had acted with Mrs. Andrews; the improbability
that I should have taken so much trouble,
had I been the thief who stole the box, full of
snuff, as the prosecutor described it to have been,
and on every other point which I thought might
prove of moment, or afford the counsel an opportunity
of shewing his wit or ingenuity, but still deceiving
even him, by stoutly adhering to my first
story of finding the property. This brief I sent by
my wife, with the usual fee, to Mr. Knapp, a gentleman,
of whose abilities I entertained a high
opinion. Notwithstanding all this, I had at the
bottom, very little hopes of escaping conviction;
and persons best experienced in such matters, who
heard the circumstances, declared nothing but a
miracle could save me. I, however, concealed these
unpleasing ideas from my wife, and assured her<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
that I felt confident of being acquitted. The grand
jury being met, I soon heard that a true bill had
been returned by them; and, on the following Wednesday,
the court opening, I was taken down for
trial, but was not put to the bar until Friday the 2d
of December. Previous to my leaving the ward of
the prison in which I lodged, a fellow-prisoner, with
whom I had become intimate, knowing the circumstances
of my case, and the nature of my intended
defence, had in a half-jocular manner, offered to
lend me his snuff-box, which he advised me to display
to the court, and occasionally to take a pinch
from it during my trial; this he observed, would
strengthen my assertion that I was in the habit of
using snuff, and give a colour to my defence; and,
he good-naturedly added, that he hoped it would
prove lucky to me. I thankfully accepted the proffered
favour, of which I did not fail to make use
at the proper season. Being arraigned at the bar,
I stood capitally indicted for stealing a silver snuff-box,
value two pounds, the property of Thomas
Imeson, privily from his person. Mr. Imeson
having given his evidence, my counsel in cross-examining
him said, “I take for granted, Sir, you can’t
take upon yourself to swear, whether you were
robbed of your snuff-box, or whether it fell through
the hole in your pocket; all you know is, that you
found your pocket torn, and the box among other
articles missing?” <i>Answer</i>, “Certainly I cannot.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
The landlady then stated in a faltering voice, and
evidently much embarrassed at being examined
before so large an assembly, the manner in which
I had applied to her, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and in answer to a question
from Mr. Knapp, said, that she could never
suppose I should have acted in the open manner I
did, if I had stolen the box. The constable who
searched me was the next witness; and he having
described that proceeding, and produced the articles
found upon me, the Recorder, who presided on the
bench, said, “I suppose, Mr. Bell, there were a
great variety of characters attending this meeting,
which was held for the purpose of obtaining parliamentary
reform?”</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> “Certainly, my lord.”</p>

<p><i>Recorder.</i> “No doubt there were many persons,
freeholders as well as not freeholders?”</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> “Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p><i>Recorder.</i> “I dare say people of all descriptions,
tag-rag, and bobtail?”</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> “There might, my lord.”</p>

<p>I now began to entertain strong hopes, perceiving
that the tide of prejudice ran in my favour.
I was dressed in a very genteel but becoming
manner, and had not the least appearance of a
thief. I had put on the most modest air and
countenance I could assume, and I thought the
court and jury appeared to view me with favourable
eyes. I, therefore, took another pinch from my<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
friend’s box, and waited the event with patience,
being prepared with a good defence, when called
upon to make it. But I was not put to that
trouble; for the Recorder addressing the jury, said,
“Gentlemen, I must in this stage of the trial, deliver
it as my opinion, that I cannot see any grounds
for charging the prisoner with felony. Gentlemen,
the accident of finding a snuff-box might have happened
to one of yourselves, to me, or to any other
honest man; and, it would be hard indeed if such an
accident should subject the finder to a prosecution
for felony. If you are of my opinion, it will be
unnecessary to recapitulate the evidence, or put
the prisoner upon his defence.” His Lordship
then paused, and I leave the reader to imagine the
state of suspense I was for some moments in. The
jury having whispered together, one of them stood
up and said, “My lord, we wish to ask a question
of Mrs. Andrews, namely, whether at the time the
prisoner brought her the box, he delivered it as his
own, or said he had found it?” Mr. Knapp eagerly
catching at this question, desired Mrs Andrews to
stand up, and said to her, “Mrs. Andrews, the jury
wish to ask you whether the young man at the bar
told you it was his own snuff-box, or whether he said
he had found it?” The poor simple woman, confused
and trembling, and not comprehending the
drift or importance of the question, answered in a
low voice, “He said he had found it, gentlemen.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Mr. Knapp having obtained this answer, with a
smile, or rather laugh of satisfaction, turned to the
jury, repeating her words, “He said, he had found
it. I hope, Gentlemen, you are now satisfied.”
He then folded up my brief, and handed it to an
officer of the court, to whom he made a motion
with his hand to return it to me. I received it
with a respectful bow of acknowledgment, and
Mr. Knapp threw himself back in his seat, and
began playing with his watch-chain, as much as to
say, “the business is settled, I have successfully
done my duty, and saved my client;” and, so indeed
he had, for the foreman immediately pronounced
the welcome verdict of “Not Guilty.” There is
one circumstance to which my acquittal on this
occasion may be in a great measure imputed;
namely, that I was fortunately not known by any
of the turnkeys or officers of the court, who never
fail when an old face appears, to give a private
intimation to the judge, if (which is very rare) he
should not himself recognise the party. I now
applied to the court for the articles taken from me,
which the Recorder ordered to be restored; but
first expressed a wish to view them, saying to the
constable, “Let me look at those articles, Mr.
Bell, there is nothing remarkable in them I suppose.”
The malicious constable answered, “No,
my lord, without it is the scissors.” The Recorder,
having minutely examined them, replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
“I see nothing extraordinary in <i>them</i> neither, Mr.
Bell, except that they appear to be remarkable
good ones—poo, poo, let the young man have his
property by all means:” on which the fellow,
evidently chagrined, delivered the whole into my
hands. As to the snuff-box, his Lordship observed,
there could be no doubt but it was the
same which Mr. Imeson had lost, though he could
only speak to its identity, as being of the same
pattern, having bought it but a few days before the
accident, and there being no mark which he could
know it by: he was, therefore, ordered to retain it.
I then bowed with gratitude to the court and jury,
and with respect to the auditors, and quitting the
bar, had my irons knocked off, and was received
with open arms by my dear wife, who had been
waiting the issue in anxious suspense, accompanied
by my friend Bromley. We all three returned to
the prison, where I had left some little matters,
and every one was astonished at my acquittal. I
restored the borrowed snuff-box to my kind friend,
not forgetting to acknowledge its beneficial effects
by a present to himself, and a liberal treat to the
whole ward. I afterwards sent for a coach, in
which myself, my wife, and old companion, were
driven to my lodgings in Duke’s-court, Drury-lane;
and, I need not add, that we spent the remainder
of the day in festivity, and heartfelt satisfaction.
To account for my absence from home, my wife<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
had informed the landlord, that I had met with an
accident while at a friend’s house a few miles from
town, and could not be removed until I was perfectly
recovered. Notwithstanding I blessed Heaven
for this fortunate escape, which I had so little reason
to expect, and thought myself supremely happy in
recovering my liberty; yet I have ever since regretted
that I was not then convicted, as there is
little doubt but the capital part of the charge would
have been done away with, and I should only have
been transported for seven years, consequently, at
the period of my writing these Memoirs, I should
have had only a few months to serve before I became
a free-man; whereas the sequel will shew
that I was in a short time afterwards cast for death,
and now find myself in the hopeless and deplorable
situation of a prisoner for life!</p>

and the Return I made for it.—Perfidy of a
Pawnbroker.—Obliged to decamp with Precipitation.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next adventure I shall have occasion to relate,
more fully confirms the justice of the remark, that
the connexions formed by persons during temporary
confinement in a jail, commonly lead to further acts
of wickedness, and frequently entail on the parties a
more severe punishment than that which they have
just escaped. This was exactly my unhappy case,
and I now come to the most fatal era of my
eventful life.</p>

<p>In the same ward with myself were confined two
brothers, very genteel young men, who had been
recently cast for death for privately stealing some
valuable rings, <i>&amp;c.</i>, from the shop of a Jeweller in
Leadenhall-street. As a conformity of character,
or similarity of pursuits, is the strongest source of
friendship, so these persons and myself had become
very intimately acquainted. In the course of our
frequent conversations on the subject with which we
were all three alike most conversant, the brothers
informed me that they had, like myself, made a successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
tour of the jewellers’ shops in London; and
on our comparing notes as to the particular persons
we had robbed, or attempted to rob, they pointed
out about half a dozen shops, which, it appeared,
I had omitted to visit, arising either from their
making no display of their goods, or from their being
situated in private streets, where I had no idea of
finding any such trades. Though at that time neither
they nor myself entertained much hope of my acquittal,
it was agreed that in the event of my being
so fortunate as to recover my freedom, I should pay
my respects to the several tradesmen I had so overlooked;
and I promised, in case I was successful, to
make them a pecuniary acknowledgment in return
for their information. At the moment of my joyful
departure from Newgate, they accordingly furnished
me with a list of the shops in question, and gave
me full instructions and useful hints for my guidance
therein. They particularly pointed out Mr. Bilger,
a goldsmith and jeweller of the first eminence in
Piccadilly. This gentleman, they assured me, I
should find, in the technical phrase, a <i>good flat</i>. They
advised me to bespeak a diamond ring, or similar
article, and to request a sight of some loose diamonds
for the purpose of selecting such stones as I
might wish to have set, informing me that he was
generally provided with a large quantity, which he
would not fail to shew me, and that I might with ease
purloin a good number of them. A day or two after<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
my release, I made the prescribed experiments,
and was fortunate enough to succeed pretty well at
nearly every shop, but I reserved Mr. Bilger for
my final essay, as he was the principal object of
consideration, and from whom I expected to obtain
the most valuable booty. On the day se’ennight after
my trial at the Old Bailey, I prepared in due form
to pay him a visit. About five o’clock in the evening,
I entered his shop, dressed in the most elegant
style, having a valuable gold watch and appendages,
a gold eye-glass, <i>&amp;c.</i> I had posted my old friend
and aid-de-camp, Bromley, at the door, in order to
be in readiness to act as circumstances might require,
and particularly to watch the motions of Mr.
Bilger and his assistants on my quitting the premises.
On my entrance Mrs. Bilger issued from a
back-parlour behind the shop, and politely inquiring
my business, I told her I wished to see Mr. Bilger;
she immediately rang a bell, which brought down her
husband from the upper apartments. He saluted
me with a low bow, and handed me a seat. I was
glad to find no other person in the shop, Mrs. Bilger
having again retired. I now assumed the air of a
Bond-street lounger, and informed Mr. Bilger that
I had been recommended by a gentleman of my acquaintance
to deal with him, having occasion for a
very elegant diamond ring, and requested to see his assortment.
Mr. Bilger expressed his concern that
he happened not to have a single article of that description<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
by him, but if I could without inconvenience
call again, he would undertake in one hour to
procure me a selection from his working-jeweller,
to whom he would immediately despatch a messenger.
I affected to feel somewhat disappointed, but
looking at my watch, after a moment’s reflection, I
said, “Well, Mr. Bilger, I have an appointment at
the Canon coffee-house, which requires my attendance,
and if you will without fail have the articles
ready, I may probably look in a little after six.”
This he promised faithfully to do, declaring how
much he felt obliged by my condescension; and I
sauntered out of the shop, Mr. Bilger attending me
in the most obsequious manner to the outer door.
After walking a short distance, Bromley tapped me
on the shoulder, and inquired what conduct I meant
next to pursue; for he had viewed my proceedings
through a glass-door in the shop, and saw that I had
not executed my grand design. I related to Bromley
the result of my conversation with Mr. Bilger,
and added that I meant to retire to the nearest
public-house, where we could enjoy a pipe and a
glass of negus until the expiration of the hour to
which I had limited myself. We accordingly regaled
ourselves at a very snug house, nearly opposite
Bilger’s, until about half after six, when I again
repaired to the scene of action, leaving Bromley, as
at first, posted at the door. Mr. Bilger received me
with increased respect, and producing a small card<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
box, expressed his sorrow that his workman had
only been enabled to send three rings for my inspection,
but that if they were not to my taste he should
feel honoured and obliged in taking my directions
for having one made, and flattered himself he should
execute the order to my satisfaction. I proceeded
to examine the rings he produced, one of which was
marked sixteen guineas, another nine guineas, and
the third six guineas. They were all extremely
beautiful, but I affected to consider them as too
paltry, telling Mr. Bilger that I wanted one to present
to a lady, and that I wished to have a ring of
greater value than the whole three put together, as
a few guineas would not be an object in the price.
Mr. Bilger’s son, who was also his partner, now
joined us, and was desired by his father to sketch a
draught in pencil of some fancy rings, agreeable to
the directions I should give him. The three rings
I had viewed, were now removed to the end of the
counter next the window, and I informed the young
man that I wished to have something of a cluster, a
large brilliant in the centre, surrounded with smaller
ones; but repeated my desire that no expense might
be spared to render the article strictly elegant, and
worthy a lady’s acceptance. The son having
sketched a design of several rings on a card, I examined
them with attention, and appeared in doubt
which to prefer, but desired to see some loose diamonds,
in order to form a better idea of the size, <i>&amp;c.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of each ring described in the drawing. Mr. Bilger,
however, declared he had not any by him. It is
probable he spoke truth: or he might have lost such
numbers by shewing them, as to deter him from exhibiting
them in future. Without having made up my
mind on the subject, I now requested to see some of
his most fashionable broaches or shirt-pins. Mr. Bilger
produced a shew-glass, containing a great variety
of articles in pearl, but he had nothing of the kind in
diamonds. I took up two or three of the broaches
and immediately <i>sunk</i> a very handsome one marked
three guineas, in my coat sleeve. I next purloined
a beautiful clasp for a lady’s waist, consisting of stones
set in gold, which had the brilliancy and appearance
of real diamonds, but marked only four guineas.
I should probably have gone still deeper, but at
this moment a lady coming in, desired to look at
some ear-rings, and the younger Mr. Bilger immediately
quitted his father to attend upon her at the
other end of the shop. It struck me that now was
my time for a decisive stroke. The card containing
the diamond rings, procured from the maker,
lying very near the shew-glass I was viewing, and
many small articles irregularly placed round about
them, the candles not throwing much light upon that
particular spot, and Mr. Bilger’s attention being
divided between myself and the lady, to whom he
frequently addressed himself, I suddenly took the
three rings from the card, and committed them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
my sleeve to join the broach and lady’s clasp; but
had them so situated that I could in a moment have
released and replaced them on the counter, had an
inquiry been made for them. I then looked at my
watch, and observing that I was going to the theatre,
told Mr. Bilger that I would not trouble him any
further, as the articles before me were too tawdry
and common to please me, but that I would put the
card of draughts in my pocket-book, and if I did
not meet with a ring of the kind I wanted before Monday
or Tuesday, I would certainly call again and give
him final directions. I was then drawing on my
gloves, being anxious to quit the shop while I was
well; but Mr. Bilger, who seemed delighted with
the prospect of my custom, begged so earnestly that
I would allow him to shew me his brilliant assortment
of gold watches that I could not refuse to
gratify him, though I certainly incurred a great risk
by my compliance. I, therefore, answered, “Really,
Mr. Bilger, I am loth to give you that unnecessary
trouble, as I have, you may perceive, a very good
watch already, in point of performance; though it
cost me a mere trifle, only twenty guineas; but it
answers my purpose as well as a more valuable one.
However, as I may probably, before long, want an
elegant watch for a lady, I don’t care if I just run
my eye over them.” Mr. Bilger replied, that the
greater part of his stock were fancy watches adapted
for ladies, and he defied all London united to exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
a finer collection. He then took from his
window a shew-glass, containing about thirty most
beautiful watches, some ornamented with pearls or
diamonds, others elegantly enamelled, or chased in
the most delicate style. They were of various prices,
from thirty to one hundred guineas, and the old
gentleman rubbing his hands with an air of rapture,
exclaimed, “There they are, Sir; a most fashionable
assortment of goods; allow me to recommend
them; they’re all a-going, Sir—all a-going.” I
smiled inwardly at the latter part of this speech, and
thought to myself, “I wish they were going, with
all my heart, along with the diamond rings.” I
answered, they were certainly very handsome, but I
would defer a minute inspection of them till my next
visit, when I should have more time to spare. These
watches were ranged in exact order, in five parallel
lines, and between each watch was placed a gold seal
or other trinket appertaining to a lady’s watch. It was
no easy matter, therefore, to take away a single article
without its being instantly missed, unless the
economy of the whole had been previously deranged.
I contrived, however, to displace a few of the trinkets,
on pretence of admiring them, and ventured to
secrete one very rich gold seal marked six guineas.
I then declared I could stay no longer, as I had appointed
to meet a party at the theatre; but that I
would certainly call again in a few days, and lay out
some money in return for the trouble I had given.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Mr. Bilger expressed his thanks in the most respectful
terms, and waited upon me to the door, where
he took leave of me with a very low <i>congé</i>, <i>à la mode
de France</i>, of which country he was a native. I
now put the best foot foremost, and having gained
a remote street, turned my head, and perceived
Bromley at my heels, who seized my hand, congratulating
me on my success, and complimenting me
on the address I had shewn in this exploit; for he
had witnessed all that passed, and knew that I had
succeeded in my object, by the manner in which I
quitted the shop. He informed me that Mr. Bilger,
had returned to his counter, and without attending
to the arrangement of the articles thereon, had joined
his son who was still waiting upon the lady, and
that he, Bromley, had finally left them both engaged
with her.</p>

<p>Having thus happily achieved this adventure we
returned to my lodgings, where I displayed the
booty I had made, and gratified Bromley with a
couple of guineas for his trouble, which fully satisfied
him, as I did not take him with me on terms of
equal partnership. The next morning, Saturday,
on reviewing the articles, my wife was so much
pleased with one of the rings, (a beautiful ruby,
surrounded with rose-diamonds, price six guineas,)
which exactly fitted her fore-finger, that I suffered
her to retain it for wearing on extraordinary occasions;
and I myself determined to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
one marked sixteen guineas, (which was a double
rowed brilliant half hoop,) for my little finger. As
to the nine-guinea ring, (which was composed of
brilliants, having a space for hair in the centre,) I
sold it immediately, together with the gold seal, to
a Jew-receiver, with whom I had frequent dealings.
The broach I also took a fancy to for my own wear,
and the gold clasp I presented to my wife. In the
evening of this day I visited my friends in Newgate,
(the two brothers,) and acknowledged the service
they had rendered me by a suitable present, besides
regaling the whole ward with a treat of ale and porter.</p>

<p>In the interval between my discharge from confinement,
and my visit to Mr. Bilger, I one day
went to the shop of a pawnbroker, in Brydges-street,
Covent-garden, for the purpose of pledging
some seals, rings, and other trinkets, which I had
purloined at the several shops to which the brothers
had recommended me. I had frequently pledged
similar articles at this shop, as well as many others,
because I could get nearly fifty per cent more by
that means than a common receiver would give for
the same goods, and I afterwards sold the duplicates
among my acquaintances, or to the Jews, by which
I gained a still further advance. I entered a private
box, as is usual with persons who wish to observe
secrecy; and the pawnbroker, whose name
was Turner, coming himself to wait on me, I produced
my goods, demanding a certain sum upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
them. Mr. Turner having looked over the articles,
pulled out the sliding shutter which extends across
the counter, so as to obscure the customer from the
view even of a person in the adjoining box, and having
taken this precaution, he spoke to me, in a very respectful
manner, to the following effect: “Sir, I
hope you will excuse what I am going to say; but
having observed that you frequently pledge similar
goods to these at our shop, which are afterwards
taken out by other persons, I take for granted
you are in the habit of selling the duplicates; it is
not my wish to be impertinently curious, but my
reason for asking, is, that if I am right in my conjecture,
I conceive you might as well give me the
opportunity of purchasing them as a stranger. I am
ready to give you a fair price, as I have opportunities
of disposing of such goods in the way of trade, and
without putting them in the window, or exposing
them at all. Or if you prefer selling them at once,
I will offer you the utmost farthing I can give, at a
word, and save both you and myself the trouble of
a duplicate.” All this he uttered in a low but
earnest voice, and with every appearance of sincerity.
Perceiving me to hesitate, he added with increased
emphasis, “Depend on it, Sir, I’ll deal upon the
square with you; I don’t mean to take the smallest
advantage, I assure you.” These last words determined
me. I thought it improbable that he could
have any motive for deceiving me, and knowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
that many of the pawnbrokers in London are men
of the world, who, while they preserve outwardly a
fair reputation, are at the bottom arrant receivers of
stolen goods, I supposed this man to be one of
them; I therefore answered that he was not mistaken
in his opinion; that I was myself in the habit
of dealing in such goods, and being sometimes
pressed for money, I was then obliged to pledge or
sell a few articles, to relieve a temporary inconvenience;
and that, relying upon his promises of
fair dealing, I had no objection, when such was the
case, to give him an opportunity of becoming a purchaser.
He thanked me for the favour, and desired
I would set a price upon the articles I had now
brought. I did so, and he offered me at once a
sum equal to what I expected, though somewhat
less than I asked him. Having received the
money agreed for, I departed, well pleased
with having formed so good a connexion. I
only describe this interview as explanatory of
a circumstance I shall by and by have occasion to
relate.</p>

<p>Any body would suppose that I might have been
satisfied with my late success at Bilger and Son’s,
and it will hardly be credited that I should have
the temerity to pay them a second visit, agreeably
to the promise I gave Mr. Bilger at parting: but,
such was nevertheless the fact. On the Monday
following the Friday on which I robbed them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
having occasion for a little ready money to pay an
instalment to my tailor, with whom I kept a running
account, I requested my wife to take the diamond-ring
I had kept for my own wear, and pledge it
at Turner’s for five guineas, while I myself went
with her ring to another shop, and borrowed three
guineas on it. I conceived there could be no
danger attending this proceeding, as there was nothing
remarkable in either of the rings, and I had
the fullest conviction that the pawnbroker to whom
I applied, was actually such a character as from
the conversation of Turner, I doubted not the latter
to be: besides, it was in my power at a minute’s
warning to have redeemed both, and I intended so
to do in a few days. The next day (Tuesday,) I
determined to re-visit Mr. Bilger, against the advice
both of my wife and Bromley, who censured such
a step as an act of downright madness, which
indeed it certainly was: but I was so infatuated as
to think it possible that as there was another party
in the shop as well as myself, the suspicion might
have attached to her; or, that my appearance and
address would so far operate in my favour, as at
least to leave Bilger in doubt who to suspect: in
which case, my calling again exactly at the time
I had promised, would certainly remove every shadow
of such doubt, and I might perhaps be enabled to
obtain one or more of the valuable watches Mr.
Bilger had shewn me. To make every thing secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
I intended to take Bromley with me, who could
observe the reception I met with, and in the event
of my being detained on suspicion, I directed him
to hasten to my wife with the information, who was
instantly to redeem the two rings we had pledged,
and then effectually conceal the whole of the stolen
articles beyond the reach of discovery; so that no
property being found on, or traced to me, I must
inevitably have been discharged. These precautions
were certainly sufficient to prevent any ill
consequences, but still I shall ever condemn myself
for so rash an act. About six o’clock in the evening,
myself and Bromley set out on this ill-fated
expedition. Arriving at Bilger’s, I entered with an
air of confidence, and finding the son only in the
shop, I addressed him with a good-natured smile in
these words: “Well, Sir, you see I’m punctual to
my promise: is your father within?” He answered
in the affirmative, with a mixture of surprise and
doubt in his countenance; then stepping backwards,
he called Mr. Bilger, saying in a significant tone,
“Father, here is the gentleman come about the
diamond ring.” Mr. Bilger then advancing, saluted
me with a formal coldness, which convinced me
that I was suspected. However, it was then too
late to recede, so laying my hat upon the counter,
and drawing a stool, I said, with a familiar air,
“Well, Mr. Bilger, I have called to give you directions
for making this ring, but I must beg that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
will spare no pains in the execution, as I repeat that
the price will not be an object; only tell me candidly
at what time you will undertake to have it ready, as
I am going out of town in a few days.” He replied,
that I might depend on it by Saturday
evening. “Very well,” said I, “that will be time
enough.” Mr. Bilger then desired his son to take
down my instructions, for which purpose the latter
opened his day-book, and I took from my pocket
the card of draughts, in which I pointed out the
one I had determined on. Then describing minutely
the various particulars, the kind of shank, <i>&amp;c.</i>;
the young man wrote what he thought necessary,
appearing to pay the strictest attention to my directions,
and concluded with requesting my name
and address. I answered (what first came into
my head, as my only object now was to get decently
clear of the shop,) “Mr. Deakin, 13, Curzon-street,
May-fair.” I next desired Mr. Bilger
to shew me again his assortment of lady’s watches,
as I intended to purchase one when the ring was
completed; but, the old gentleman replied with
evident embarrassment, that he really had none in
the house, but that his son should wait upon me
with a selection, when the ring was finished! I
answered carelessly, “that will do very well, Mr
Bilger. I hope, Sir, you will not fail to be punctual;
let it be an elegant article, and don’t neglect
to send the watches. I shall now bid you good<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
evening.” Then buttoning my coat, <i>&amp;c.</i>, I advanced
toward the door, expecting every moment to be
detained, or at least questioned about the three
diamond rings. Nothing of the sort, however,
occurred. Mr. Bilger attended me to the door
with as much politeness, though not quite the same
warmth as at my first visit; and I was not at all
sorry when I found myself at a distance from the
shop. My watchful friend Bromley soon joined
me, with the information that Bilger had stood
above a minute gazing after me before he closed
the door, and that he clearly perceived I had had
a narrow escape. Having satisfied myself by making
the experiment, I now hastened home to relieve
the anxiety of my wife; and concluding I should
neither see or hear any more of Messrs. Bilger and
Son, turned my attention to new projects for “raising
the wind.”</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, calling at Turner’s, the
pawnbroker, to dispose of some trifling articles,
that person, after apologizing for the liberty he was
about to take, begged leave to ask if my “good
lady” had not pledged a diamond-ring with him a
few days before, for five guineas? Surprised at this
question, I hesitated; on which he continued, “I
assure you, Sir, I have no impertinent motive for
the question, but a lady of my acquaintance having
seen the article, is very much in love with it; and,
if it should be yours, and that you are inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
hereafter to sell it, I should be happy to purchase
it for her. The lady who pledged it having frequently
come to redeem articles left by you, I
concluded from thence that she was your wife.”
As I was willing to be upon my guard, I answered,
that my wife had indeed several rings, and it was
possible he might be right in his conjecture, but I
was ignorant of her having pledged such an article;
that I would, however, make inquiry on the subject,
and let him know the next time I saw him. Having
communicated this conversation to my wife, she
saw nothing extraordinary in it, as the ring was a
very elegant trinket, and would naturally excite the
admiration of any lady. The next day, I again
called upon Turner, and told him that the ring he
mentioned was the property of my wife, but at
present she had no mind to part with it, and here
the matter dropped.</p>

<p>Three or four days after this last interview,
having been successful at the theatres, and my purse
being replenished, I determined to redeem the ring
pledged at Turner’s, and taking the duplicate with
me, I entered one of the private boxes as usual,
from a back door in Russell-court, and calling to
the shopman, produced my ticket, and desired to
have the ring. The lad took the former out of my
hand, and laid it on a shelf; then proceeded with
the business he was before engaged in, without
offering to attend to me. I thought this very odd,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
and seeing Turner himself at the far end of the
counter, writing duplicates for some women, and
pretending to be so much engaged as not to notice
me, though I was sensible he must, I began, as the
phrase is, to <i>smell a rat</i>. I then repeated my
request to the boy, with some impatience, and a
louder voice, on which the latter went up to his
master, and I heard him whisper, “Sir, here’s the
gentleman come for the diamond-ring.” His master,
without turning his head, or looking off his book,
(though he always used to pay the most eager
attention to me,) said something I could not hear;
and the lad approaching the box in which I stood,
told me his master would be glad if I would step
round to the front door, (meaning the door of the
public shop, which opened into Brydges-street.) I
was now more than ever surprised, and convinced
that mischief was intended me. However, as in
such cases, I was often too rash, and despised
fear as unbecoming an adventurer of my address
and appearance, I answered, “O by all means, my
man, I’ll go round;” which I immediately did;
but on entering the shop, I was surprised to find
that Mr. Turner had vanished. I then said to the
boy, with a smile of gaiety, “Why, my good lad, I
don’t see your master, now I’ve taken the trouble
to come here.” The boy replied, “Sir, my master
will wait upon you directly; he’s only gone backwards
to speak to the servant.” This was enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
for me. I no longer doubted that he was gone to
send for an officer; and that it was, therefore, high
time for me to make sail while I was well. I, therefore,
appeared for a moment satisfied with the boy’s
answer, but seeming suddenly to recollect myself,
I said to him, “My wife is at the door; I believe
I may as well ask her to step in,” Then immediately
opening the door, which fell to with a pulley, I
quitted the shop and turning the corner, got into
Russell-court, through which I ran with all my
speed, nor stopped till I found myself at a considerable
distance, and out of all danger. I then walked
home by a circuitous route, and related the adventure
to my wife, who was, of course, seriously
alarmed, and joined with me in reprobating the
treachery of the pawnbroker, for whose perfidious
conduct, after the assurances he had given me, we
were at a loss to account.</p>

<p>As my person was well known to all the surrounding
pawnbrokers, and my real abode to many of them,
myself and wife were under considerable alarm at
every knock we heard at the house-door that evening;
and it was my wife’s earnest entreaty that I
should the next morning look out for a lodging in a
remote part of the town, where I might lie concealed
for awhile until the affair had cooled. Accordingly
I went out with that intention at an early hour,
and engaged a first floor very neatly furnished, in
Webber-row, St. George’s Fields; to which we
removed with our effects, in the most private manner,
the very next day. As I had taken care that we
were not watched in our removal, we found ourselves
freed from any immediate anxiety in our new abode;
but I was afraid to shew myself at all in the neighbourhood
of our late residence, nor could I venture<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
even to the theatres in quest of money. We, therefore,
continued domesticated until after Christmas;
but finding the rent we paid (fourteen shillings per
week,) to come rather heavy upon us, as I was
getting nothing, but living on the little I had by me,
I determined to hire a small house in one of the
new streets near the Obelisk, and to purchase such
articles of furniture as were indispensable, whatever
sacrifices I might make to enable me to do so. I very
soon met with a neat little house, in Gun-street, at the
low rent of five shillings a week. It consisted indeed
of only two rooms, one over the other, with a small
kitchen behind, but was sufficiently large for our
purpose. I was so assiduous in this undertaking,
that in a few days I had purchased every necessary
article for our use, and we immediately entered on the
premises. It is true, having but little ready money,
I was compelled on this occasion to pledge my watch,
chain, and seals, together with several trinkets of
my own and my wife’s, and many articles of our
wearing apparel, but of the latter we had both a pretty
ample stock. We were then obliged to live as
frugally as possible, and during the whole month of
January I never once stirred out of the street we
resided in, except on the following occasion. Being
anxious to see poor Bromley, whom I had not
had an opportunity of apprizing of our removal
from Drury-lane, I determined to venture out, and
endeavour to find him at one of the houses I knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
he frequented in that neighbourhood: for this purpose
I disguised myself as much as I could, and going
late in the evening to a public-house in Parker’s
lane, I found a number of dissolute characters of
the lowest class, assembled there, but on looking
round saw no appearance of Bromley. Having drank
a glass at the bar, I was on the point of quitting the
house to seek further, when a girl of the town, of
whom there were a number present, tapped me on
the shoulder, and, taking me aside, observed that
she was astonished at my madness in venturing to
that quarter of the town, considering the situation
in which I stood, and the consequent risk I incurred.
This girl had formerly cohabited with Bromley, and
had by that means known me for some time. As
I knew her to be incapable of any bad design, I
requested her to explain herself more fully. She
then said, that she had gone a few days before this
to the shop of Lane, a pawnbroker in Drury-lane,
on some business of her own, and that one of the
shopmen inquired if she had lately seen Vaux? desiring
her, if she met with me, to caution me to keep
out of the way, as I was advertised, and very fully
described in printed hand-bills, circulated among the
pawnbrokers, in which I stood charged with robbing
a jeweller’s shop in Piccadilly; that being on intimate
terms with this shopman, she had obtained a
sight of the hand-bill in question, and had read with
her own eyes a confirmation of what the young man<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
had told her. She now repeated to me the tenor of
the same, stating that a reward of ten guineas was
offered for my apprehension, and ten guineas more
on my conviction; that the articles stolen, consisting
of diamond-rings, <i>&amp;c.</i>, were described, as was
also my dress, and person, in the minutest manner,
not excepting even my whiskers, eyes, and teeth,
the watch and appendages I wore, the mourning-ring
on my finger, eye-glass, <i>&amp;c.</i> She, therefore, strongly
exhorted me to avoid this part of the town, in which
I was so well known; and promised if she saw
Bromley, to direct him to a place I named, at which
he would hear of me. Having gratified this well-meaning
woman with a small present, I returned
home with all the speed I could; and ruminating
in my way on what I had heard, I was now
convinced beyond a doubt, that Bilger junior, at the
time he pretended to be taking directions of me
for the ring I bespoke, was actually intent upon
taking a description of my person, <i>&amp;c.</i>, which he
wrote down in the book before him, in order that,
should his father’s suspicions prove well founded,
a proper search might be made after me. This
news was not likely to alleviate the anxiety of my
wife for my safety, or to encourage me in sallying
forth with the view of recruiting my finances, which
were now at a very low ebb.</p>

<p>At length, however, necessity compelled me to
wave every consideration, for every thing we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
conveniently spare was in pawn, including even my
books, some of which were valuable. I, therefore,
dressed myself in my usual manner, and, on Tuesday
evening, the 31st of January 1809, left my home,
with an intention of trying my luck at one of the
Theatres; but in my way thither, I was induced to
enter a shop, (namely, Sharp’s, the razor-maker, corner
of Ludgate-hill,) of which I had conceived some
hopes; and fortune favoured me so far, that I obtained
a booty of silver fruit-knives, pencil-cases,
pocket-books with instruments, <i>&amp;c.</i>, which I estimated
at four or five guineas. I was so pleased
with this success that I returned home, satisfied
with my night’s gain, and gave up my former design
of going to the Theatre. My wife was agreeably
surprised at my premature return; and, as it was
then but seven o’clock, I proposed to her that we
should take a walk as far as Blackfriars’-bridge, as
she had of late been closely confined to the house,
and I conceived her health required air and exercise.
She immediately assented, and having locked up the
house, we proceeded towards the bridge; on arriving
at which she would have turned back, but I
persuaded her to cross the water, and go as far as
the end of Fleet-street. We there entered a liquor-shop,
and took some refreshment; and my wife
then earnestly pressed me to return, for fear of
meeting with some of the officers who might know
me; but I now entreated her to walk as far as Clare-market,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
as I wished to see a young man who had
promised to meet me, or to leave a note for me at a
certain public-house, which I had sometimes frequented
when I lived in that neighbourhood. I had,
in fact, intended to call there in my way to or from
the theatre, in order to settle a plan for accompanying
this person and several others, to a grand fight,
which was to have taken place the next day at
Moulsey-burst, between two celebrated pugilists, and
at which we expected to reap a plentiful harvest.
The going to this house was the maddest act I
could possibly have committed, for the Bow-street
officers were in the habit of visiting it at all hours;
and several of them had seen me there at various
times, dressed exactly in the manner described in
the hand-bills I have mentioned. My wife, who
appears to have had too sure a presentiment of what
the consequence would be, used every art to dissuade
me from my purpose, but in vain. I assured
her that I would not stop five minutes; and that to
prevent danger, she herself should first enter the
house, and observe whether there were any officers
in it, in which event I could but retire without
going in, and immediately return home. Finding I
was obstinately determined on this rash step, she
accompanied me, and, on arriving near the house.
I sent her into make observations. The landlord
(who had himself been an old thief), received her
very courteously; and inquiring for me, she privately<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
asked him if there was any danger of the officers
coming there? To which he answered in the negative,
and assured her I might with safety make my
appearance. She accordingly gave me the signal,
and I entered the public tap-room, in which I found
about twenty notorious characters, assembled at
different tables, some drinking and smoking, others
employed in gambling with cards, <i>&amp;c.</i> The young
man above-mentioned had left a short note, which
the landlord now put into my hand; in which I was
requested to meet him the next morning at a certain
time and place, adding that he had engaged a chaise,
and that a seat was reserved for me. My wife now
again pressed me to return after taking a glass at the
bar; but my evil genius prevailed, and I stipulated
that I should smoke one pipe of tobacco, and would
then willingly retire. I accordingly took a seat,
placing my wife between myself and my old acquaintance
George W—k—n, who invited us to join
him. I was situated with my back to the door
of the room, which opened into a passage leading to
the street. I occupied the very end of the seat
or bench, which had an elbow, on which I rested
my right arm, and there were at the same table
three or four other persons besides our party. I
had scarcely lighted my pipe when I observed two
men, (strangers to me), enter the room, and whisper
with the landlord; and I thought I perceived the landlord
while answering them, to glance his eye upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
me; but I only mention this by-the-by, as I had
the fullest conviction of the landlord’s integrity, and
the strangers had not the least appearance of officers;
consequently, the circumstance did not at all
alarm me. I had been about half an hour in the
house, and was on the point of taking my leave,
when I heard the room-door pushed open, and, as is
natural in such cases, I involuntarily turned my head;
when, to my utter confusion and alarm, I perceived
two officers enter the room. As I thought it possible
I might escape their notice, I pulled my hat
over my eyes, and turning my head towards my wife
and friend, on my left-hand, pretended to be in
earnest conversation with them; but how can I express
my feelings, when the officers walked immediately
up to me, as naturally as if they had been
sitting in my company the whole evening; and one
of them looking me full in the face, said, “Mr. Vaux,
we want you!” With as much composure as I
could assume, I answered that he was mistaken in
addressing me, for that was not my name. The
fellow replied that he was certainly right, but begged
that I would step out with him into the passage,
and he would explain himself more fully. I was
so weak (or rather so confounded with surprise)
as to comply with this request; and I was no
sooner in the passage, and the tap-room door closed,
than the two ruffians laid hold of me, one on each
side, and hurried me away with the greatest impetuosity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Having got a few yards from the house,
they stopped to view me by the light of a lamp, and
one of them having attentively surveyed my features
(probably to compare them with the advertisement)
said to his fellow, “I’m sure we are right, Jack;
he answers the description; come along.” As they
were conducting me to St. Martin’s Watch-house,
they put several questions to me, respecting my
knowledge of a jeweller’s shop in Piccadilly, my
being tried at the Old Bailey, in November sessions,
<i>&amp;c.</i>; all which were of course unavailing, as I denied
any knowledge of their meaning, but which too well
convinced me that they had a thorough knowledge
of my person and character, acquired no doubt from
the treacherous information of some of my dissolute
acquaintances. One of them observed, that if they
had not met with me this night, they should have
done so the next day at the fight, so that it had only
prevented them from seeing the battle: perhaps,
they only surmised that I should have gone there, it
being the custom for most of the London thieves to
attend such spectacles; but I have sometimes thought
my intention of going was communicated to them, either
by the person I was to have accompanied, or by
the landlord who delivered me his open note on the
subject. The other observed, that I had made a good
thing of it at the Haymarket the preceding summer;
adding, “We wondered who the devil it was, that
was so busy there; we did not know you so well<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
then as we do now, or we should have spoiled your
sport.”—The fact was, that these two vagabonds
were on constant duty every night, inside of that
theatre; and I, consequently, knew them well,
long before this fatal rencontre; but I always took
care to shun them, and had never excited their
suspicion, as I was not once during the whole season,
detected in the course of my operations at that
house.</p>

<p>We now arrived at the watch-house, where they
proceeded to search me closely, but found nothing
that had any relation to the present charge; and I
must not omit that their first attention was directed
to my little finger, no doubt in search of the mourning
ring, mentioned in the hand-bills; but the said
ring was at this time deposited as a pledge for
the loan of one pound at a certain pawnbroker’s,
and I had on, in lieu thereof, a plain gold ring of
trifling value; this they examined, and finding (to
use their words) that there were “no letters
on it,” they suffered me to retain it. I happened
unluckily to have on, this night, the very same dress
I wore when I visited Mr. Bilger, namely, a black
coat and waistcoat, blue pantaloons, Hessian boots,
and the same hat, which was remarkable, being in
the extreme of the newest fashion. The only variation
was, that I had neither the gold watch, eye-glass,
or mourning ring, about me, nor had I any powder
in my hair; and I had on over my other clothes a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
brown great-coat. After searching me, they gave
me in charge to the watch-house-keeper, and desiring
to know what name I chose to give in, as I
denied being called Vaux, I assured them my name
was James Lowe, this being the name of my much-loved
grandfather, and the first that occurred to me.
In this name I was therefore entered in the charge-book,
and, having told the keeper that they should
call for me in the morning, they departed. When left
to ruminate on my now hopeless condition, nothing
affected me so much as the distress my poor wife
must suffer, on my being thus torn from her, and
what heightened my affliction, was, the consciousness,
that had I listened to her affectionate advice, I
should probably have avoided this misfortune, and
been at that moment happy in her society, by my
own fire-side: but mature reflection convinced me,
that, my time being come, it was impossible to
escape the fate to which I was born, and destined
from the moment of that birth.—I, therefore, bowed
with resignation to a fate, which by my vicious conduct
I had certainly merited; and applied for consolation
to a pipe and a jug of ale, which I was permitted
to send for, and which indulgence I compensated
by liberally treating the keeper and his wife,
according to the established usage of such places.</p>

<p>I afterwards learnt that my wife had fainted immediately
on my apprehension, and continued for
some minutes in violent hysterics, on recovering<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
from which our friend W—k—n had kindly conducted
her home, and consoled her at parting with
the assurance that he would not sleep till he had
found out to what place I was conveyed, and done
all in his power to render my condition as tolerable
as circumstances would admit. But his inquiries
were ineffectual, and it was not till the following
day, that he could obtain an interview with me.</p>

and Conviction.</i></p>

</div>

<p>About an hour after the officers had left me,
they returned to the watch-house, bringing in
prisoner, a well-dressed gentleman in a state of
ebriety, accompanied by several of his friends, who
it seemed, had been taken in custody for riotous
conduct at the Haymarket theatre. As soon as
they had given charge of this person, and again
withdrawn, the gentleman, whose friends had also
taken their leave, seated himself near the fire, and
entered into conversation with me on the subject of
his apprehension. He informed me, that having
in the beginning of the evening had a quarrel
with another gentleman in the boxes, and their
altercation disturbing the audience, he had been
taken into custody by these officers as the aggressor;
but that having apologized for his conduct, and
made his peace with his opponent, he had been
liberated, and the officers had suddenly quitted
him; that about ten o’clock, however, to his great
surprise, the two rascally constables (as he termed<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
them,) had again apprehended him, under colour of
the original charge, and conveyed him to the watch-house;
and that in their way, they stated that they
should have done so on his first apprehension, but that
they were suddenly sent for to the other end of the town,
for the express purpose of taking a notorious thief, of
whom they had received information! The gentleman
here continued, (little supposing he was speaking
to the identical person,) “some d⸺d house-breaker,
or highwayman, I suppose. I don’t know
who the rascal was.” The reader may be sure I
took no pains to inform him; but commiserating
his case, and condemning the base conduct of the
officers, we conversed together on indifferent subjects
for about an hour, and were then shewn to
separate beds in the same room, where we were
locked up till morning. It now appeared evident
that I had been betrayed; but by whom, I am to
this day ignorant; sometimes suspecting the landlord;
at others the young man I have before mentioned;
and sometimes, one of the company who sat
at table with me; as I was afterwards informed
that the whole room being much alarmed at my
sudden apprehension, and the manner in which it
took place, some one remarked that I must certainly
have been villanously betrayed. Upon which this
man (whose name was Bill White, otherwise,
Conky-beau,) immediately changed colour, and
said, “I hope nobody suspects me, I certainly did<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
leave the room, but it was only for a few minutes,
in order to get a little tobacco at the next shop.”
At all events, there must have been much expedition
used, for I was not above half an hour in the house, and
the distance from thence to the Haymarket theatre
is at least a mile. Indeed the officers confessed to
me afterwards, that I had been <i>sold</i>, (as the phrase
is,) but declared that no bribe should induce them
to disclose the party.</p>

<p>The ensuing morning, about ten, the officers
conducted me to Bow-street, where Mr. Justice
Graham presided. On being put to the bar, I
observed Mr. Bilger, senior, and the perfidious
pawnbroker, in waiting; the former viewed me
with attention, and seemed immediately convinced
of my identity, of which he informed the magistrate.
Having then stated the particulars of his charge,
against me, (which I need not here repeat,) the
pawnbroker produced the fatal ring, stating that he
received it from a woman, whom I afterwards
acknowledged to be my wife; he also produced a
pearl and amethyst broach, set in gold, which he
deposed to purchasing from me among some other
articles of the like nature. Mr. Bilger swore that
he believed the former to be his property, and the
working jeweller, who had supplied the three rings
for my inspection, swore positively to its being one
of them; as to the broach, Mr. Bilger would not
positively swear, but fully believed it to be the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
he lost. In this, however, he was mistaken; for I
have already stated that I kept that broach for my
own wear, and it was at this moment in pledge for
one pound in the Borough; but I had, a few days
previous to my robbing Mr. Bilger, purloined,
among other trinkets, from a shop in the city, a
broach so exactly similar, that on comparing the
two together, I was in doubt which to retain;
but the pearls, in Bilger’s, being rather larger, I
preferred the latter, and disposed of the other to
Turner, as he had truly said. When asked if I had
any defence to offer, I merely answered that I was
not the person, having never seen Mr. Bilger or his
shop in my life. Mr. Graham observed, the case
was so clear that he should immediately commit me;
but having understood that many jewellers, <i>&amp;c.</i>, who
had been robbed, were in attendance to identify
me, he inquired for them; the officers, however,
stated that none were present, except a shopman of
Mr. Chandler in Leicester-fields, who had been a
considerable sufferer; but on this young man viewing
me, he declared I was not the person who had
been at his master’s shop; in which, by-the-by, he
was egregiously mistaken. The magistrate then
committed me for trial, on Mr. Bilger’s charge; and
ordered that I should be brought up again on that
day se’ennight, (the 8th of February,) in order that
the different shopkeepers might have notice to
attend. I was now conveyed to Tothill-fields<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Bridewell, where I continued a week. My first
object was to establish a communication with my
wife; but I was afraid of suffering her to visit me,
lest she might have been detained as an accomplice.
She, however, sent her sister to me daily, who brought
me every needful requisite for my use and comfort
in the prison; and among the rest, a change of
apparel of a very different kind from that in which
I was apprehended. Having put on these clothes,
I sent the others back by the bearer; and the same
day, a barber attending, whom I had sent for to shave
me, I requested him to cut off my whiskers, and to
crop my hair close. He did so, and I now cut
so different a figure, that no person could possibly
identify me, unless intimately acquainted with my
features. Had I been enabled to take these measures
before I appeared at Bow-street, it is probable Mr.
Bilger would not have ventured to swear to me; but
unfortunately they were adopted too late to render
me any essential service. When the officers came
to the prison, and saw the metamorphose I had
undergone, they were, however, highly enraged;
charged the turnkeys with gross neglect of duty, and
want of vigilance in suffering the means to be admitted,
and threatened to represent the circumstances
to the magistrate. I laughed heartily at
their chagrin, and said all I could to heighten their
vexation. On the day appointed, I was brought
up for re-examination; but it seemed the tradesmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
who were expected, had not thought it worth their
while to attend, for none made their appearance.
Mr. Graham viewed me with evident surprise, demanding
why I was so differently dressed, and what
I had done with my whiskers<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. I answered, that I
wore whatever I found most convenient to myself,
and as to whiskers, I never had any. His Worship
stared at this assertion, and declared, that when he
first examined me, I had very large whiskers, and
my hair dressed in the fashionable mode. “However,”
added he, “I see through your design; but
it has been executed too late, and this stratagem
will not now serve your turn.” I was then finally
committed to Newgate, as the Session was to commence
on that day week (the 15th). My unhappy
wife was waiting the issue of my examination, in the
neighbourhood of the public office, and on learning
the result, took coach, and was at the door of Newgate
as soon as myself. The officers who escorted
me having retired, both my wife and I were very
kindly received by the principal turnkey, who
instantly recognised us as Mr. and Mrs. Hardy, and
expressed his concern at my so soon becoming<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
again an inmate of Newgate. He then ordered me
to have a light iron put on; and requesting to know
what ward I wished to go into, I chose the same
I had before been a member of, and to this room
my wife accompanied me. After receiving the
compliments of such of the prisoners as were before
my fellow-lodgers, (among whom were the two
brothers,) all of whom vied with each other in
contributing to our accommodation, we partook of
some tea; and having been a fortnight separated
from my beloved wife, I would not suffer her to
quit me until the next morning.</p>

<p>I had now but a few days to prepare for my approaching
trial; and though I entertained no hopes
of escaping conviction, I determined to employ a
counsel; and who so proper (thought I,) as my good
friend Mr. Knapp, who had so adroitly brought me
off on a late occasion. I, therefore, drew a brief,
in which I dwelt strongly on some particular points
both of law and fact, and enclosed it, with the
customary fee, in a letter to that gentleman, reminding
him of my being his client in November session,
and trusting he would do all in his power to extricate
me from my present embarrassment. Mr.
Knapp assured my wife that I might depend on his
best exertions, and I now waited with patience for
the event. My affectionate partner was unremitting
in her attention to me, being never absent but when
she had occasion to look into our affairs at home<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
and her sister having undertaken the care of our
house till my fate was determined, she slept with
me every night, as I had reason to fear I should soon
be removed to a place where I could not have this
indulgence. It was something singular that my
poor friend Bromley, whom I had not seen for two
months before, was brought into Newgate the very
day after myself, being committed on a capital charge
of house-breaking. Being, however, unable to pay
the fees required on the master’s side, where I was situated,
he was obliged to put up with the common side,
as it is termed; but the two yards being contiguous,
I had an opportunity of seeing him every day.</p>

<p>On Wednesday the 15th of February, 1809, I
was taken down to the sessions-house for trial; and
four persons having been successively tried for
capital offences, all of whom were convicted, I was
next put to the bar, and stood indicted “for feloniously
stealing, on the 9th of December, <i>&amp;c.</i>, a
double-rowed brilliant half-hoop ring, value 16<i>l.</i>
16<i>s.</i>; a diamond ring for hair, value 9<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i>; a
rose diamond and ruby ring, with serpent-chased
shank, value 6<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>; and a pearl and amethyst
broach, value 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>, the goods of Matthias Bilger
the elder, and Matthias Bilger the younger, privately
in their shop.” The reader will observe that I was
here indicted upon a certain act of parliament,
which makes it a capital offence to steal “goods,
wares, or merchandise, to the value of five shillings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
privately in a shop.” My indictment having been
read over, I looked round for Mr. Knapp, whom I
expected to have found prepared with his brief; but
not observing him among the other counsellors, I
inquired of the turnkeys near me, who informed me
that he was not in court. I then requested of the
judge that my trial might be deferred, on account of
the absence of my counsel. The court inquiring
who was my counsel, I answered, Mr. Knapp; upon
which Mr. Gurney, another counsellor, rising from
his seat, said, “My lord, I am authorized to plead
for Mr. Knapp.” This satisfied me, not doubting
but Mr. Gurney had my brief, and would do all
in his power; and I suffered the trial to proceed.
The indictment having been read as I have before
described, to my no small surprise, Mr. Raine, the
counsellor who had been retained by my prosecutors,
rose, and proceeded to state the case to the jury;
in doing which, according to custom, he gave so
clear a view of the facts attending my offence, and
so artfully and eloquently coloured the whole, that
I saw the jury had more than half convicted me
already, and would only listen to the subsequent
evidence as a requisite matter of form. The counsel
concluded his statement with this observation;
“If, gentlemen, these facts are clearly proved to you
in evidence, (as I persuade myself they will be,) no
doubt can remain in your minds as to the verdict
you will give.” He then proceeded to examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the witnesses. Mr. Bilger, senior, deposed what the
reader is already in possession of, with these additions;
that, a few minutes after my quitting the
shop, he missed the articles named in the indictment;
and that having, on my second visit, received
my final instructions for a ring, and the address I
have before mentioned, he went himself next day to
Curzon-street, and found No. 13 to be an empty
house! Mr. Bilger having concluded, and Mr.
Gurney not offering to cross-examine him, conformable
to the suggestions in my brief, and as I
fully expected he would, I was extremely surprised,
and was soon afterwards convinced that he had not
received any brief at all, or had any grounds to plead
upon. I, therefore, requested to ask Mr. Bilger a
question, namely, “Why he did not apprehend me
on the Tuesday night, on which he swears I came
the second time to his shop, after having missed the
property on the preceding Friday, and suspected
me for it?” <i>Ans.</i> “My lord, he had so much the
appearance of a gentleman that I thought I might
be mistaken. He was very differently dressed then
from what he is now. He wore whiskers, and an
eye-glass, and was very nicely powdered<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
son went to the door in order to get a constable,
but he observed an accomplice.” (What Mr.
Bilger meant by this last assertion, or what he would
deduce from it, I have no idea.) The next evidence
was that of Turner the pawnbroker; and I had in
my brief given such hints, that I hoped Mr. Knapp
would have effectually put this fellow out of countenance,
by making him confess that he had, at his
own request, repeatedly bought such things of me.
But here Mr. Gurney was still silent, and I saw that
it would be useless for me to ask Turner any questions.
The working-jeweller was then called to
depose to the ring, which he did in the strongest
terms. Mr. Gurney barely asked him, if he could
undertake to swear that he had not made rings
exactly similar for other shops? He replied, that he
was positive it was one of the three which he sent
to Mr. Bilger on the 9th of December. Next came
the scoundrel who took me, George Donaldson, a
constable of St. Martin’s parish; who stated that
himself and Smith, one of the Bow-street patrole,
from information they had received, apprehended
me at the Butchers’ Arms in Clare-market, in company
with a great many notorious thieves. The
evidence for the prosecution being now closed, Mr.
Gurney inquired of Mr. Bilger, senior, how many
partners he had; who answered none but his son.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Then, what other persons were in the shop, (meaning
assistants,) besides his son and himself, when he
lost his property? <i>Ans.</i> “Only a porter, who was
cleaning some plate at the further end of the counter,
at some distance from where the prisoner stood.”
All that Mr. Gurney, therefore, said or asked, any
other person might have said without reference to a
brief; and having put these simple questions, or at
least put them in a simple and careless manner,
Mr. Gurney sat himself down. The last question,
indeed, was of a most important nature, and if properly
handled, and enforced with becoming spirit,
would, I have little doubt, have rendered me the
most essential service. To explain my meaning, I
must briefly expound a point of law, with which
nine readers out of ten may be unacquainted. The
Act, under which I was indicted, provides, or is interpreted
to mean, that where there are two or more
persons employed as shopmen, <i>&amp;c.</i>, it is not sufficient
for one alone to attend upon the prisoner’s
trial; but that every one, if there was a dozen, must
personally appear, to swear that he or she did not
see or suspect the prisoner to commit the act of
robbery; because the law (always favourable to the
culprit,) presumes, that if one person out of the
whole number is absent, that very person might
possibly have suspected the prisoner; and then
such suspicion, however slight, if confessed, proves
that the robbery was not effected so privately as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
come within the meaning of the Act; consequently,
there is an end of the capital part of the charge,
and the prisoner can only be transported for seven
years. The reader will see, in the next Chapter, my
reason for being thus particular in this explanation.
The judge now summed up the evidence, and what
was most extraordinary, I was not even called on
for my defence; so much were the court prejudiced
against me, from the eloquent opening of the learned
counsel, the clear and decisive evidence of the witnesses;
and, perhaps, (above all,) from some little
private intimation they had received of my real
character and past life. However, as I felt that
no defence I could make, was likely to prevent my
conviction, I was not much concerned on the occasion;
and the jury after two minutes’ consideration
returned the fatal verdict of “Guilty.” This verdict
was no sooner pronounced, than the villain Donaldson,
standing up in the witness-box, said, “My
lord, I think it my duty to inform the court what I
know of the prisoner at the bar. I have been given
to understand that he is a very old offender, and
that he has been but a few months returned from
Botany-Bay!” At this malicious address, there
was a general murmur of indignation throughout the
whole court; and Mr. Gurney (to do him justice,)
rose with much warmth, saying, “Mr. Donaldson,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for having made
such a disclosure; you acknowledge you only have<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
this circumstance from hearsay, and had you known
it to be true, after the prisoner being capitally convicted,
it is most shameful and unmanly conduct of
you to mention it.” The malicious rascal was
justly confounded at this rebuff, and sneaked away
amidst the execrations of the auditors.</p>

<p>After my conviction I was double-ironed, and
detained in the dock until the evening, my trial
having occupied about two hours; and at eight
o’clock, I was escorted to the press-yard, and locked
up in one of the condemned cells. My poor wife
remained in the ward of the prison, to which I
belonged, until she saw me pass by, and I had only
time to console her in a few words through the bars
of the window, and take leave of her till the morning.</p>

Sentence of Death.—Am reprieved, and soon afterwards

those Receptacles of human Misery.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Besides the four men convicted the same day
as myself, there were in the cells several others who
had been cast for death the preceding session; and,
the recorder’s report not having yet been made, they
still remained under sentence, ignorant of the fate
which awaited them, but they were in expectation of
its being decided every succeeding levee-day. It is
customary to confine two condemned prisoners in
each cell, and I was destined to be the companion
of a man named Nicholls, his former bed-fellow
having suffered about a week previous to my conviction.
On the turnkeys, who attended me, opening
the door of his cell, the unhappy man (Nicholls,)
was discovered on his knees, with a book in his
hand, and evidently a prey to doubt and terror.
My conductors apologized for disturbing him, saying,
they had only brought him a companion, and
hoped he would find consolation in my society.
Poor Nicholls answered in broken accents, “My<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
God! I was a little alarmed,—I heard the keys
coming,—I thought it was the report.—What?—do
you expect it to-night?” The turnkeys replied, that
from the lateness of the hour, it was not probable;
but begged him to compose himself, and hope for
the best. They then re-locked the doors, and left
us. This unfortunate person had been convicted
of selling forged bank-notes, through the treachery
of a man, who, to save himself, had given information,
and betrayed him by a signal to the police-officers,
at the moment of the negotiation taking
place. As he was known to have carried on this
illegal and dangerous traffic to a great extent in the
town of Birmingham, where he resided, the Bank
were determined to make an example of him;
particularly as he had obstinately refused to
save his own life by disclosing, as he could have
done, most important information on the subject, so
as to lead to the detection of the fabricators. This
being the case of Nicholls, he had no hope of mercy
being extended to him; and was consequently in
hourly dread of the awful fiat which was to seal his
doom, and consign him to a shameful and premature
death. On being left alone with him, I forgot
for a moment my own situation, and feeling for
that of my ill-fated companion, whose case I already
knew, I exerted myself to console and sooth him;
not by raising in him hopes for which I knew there
was no foundation, but by exhorting him to look<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
forward to “another and a better world;” to comfort
himself with the reflection that his crime, (though
punished with death on account of its injurious tendency
in a commercial country,) was not in a moral
sense, or in the eye of God, of so black a nature as
to preclude him from the hope of mercy at that
awful tribunal “before which the judges of this
world must themselves be tried.” By these and
the like suggestions, I so far succeeded as to compose
him pretty much; and having undressed ourselves,
we went to bed. He then requested me to
read a few chapters to him, and earnestly asked my
opinion on some particular passages in the New
Testament, which applied to his situation, and of
the real meaning of which he anxiously wished to
be resolved. We had read and reasoned on these
topics until St. Paul’s clock struck ten, and were
on the point of composing ourselves to sleep, that
“balm of hurt minds,” when we were alarmed by
the rattling of keys, and the sound of voices. I
endeavoured to calm the agitation of Mr. Nicholls,
by supposing that another unhappy man had been
convicted, and was about to be introduced to the
cells; but he declared it must be the report, and
fell on his knees before the cell-door. The footsteps
approaching, our door was slowly unlocked,
and the distressing agony of my companion was now
indescribable. Mr. Newman, the jailor, entered as
quietly as possible, and taking Nicholls by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
hand, while he himself was evidently affected, he
said, “Mr. Nicholls,—the report has been made,
and—(here he would fain have paused,) I am sorry
to inform you it has been unfavourable.” <i>Nicholls.</i>
“Lord, have mercy on me! God’s will be done!
I expected it, Mr. Newman,—it is no more than I
expected.—When is it,—to suffer, Mr. Newman?”
The latter replied, “on Wednesday next.” <i>Nicholls.</i>
“I could have wished, Mr. Newman, for a little
longer time,—I’m not prepared to die,—I have
some worldly affairs to settle,—but,—God help me!—I
hope for more mercy from Him than the gentlemen
of the bank have shewn me.” Mr. Newman
then assuring him of every attention in his power,
commended him to my care, and took a tender
leave of us both, promising to see Nicholls again
in the morning. The reader will easily perceive I
had not the prospect of a very agreeable night
before me; my own situation was deplorable enough,
but the distress of my unfortunate bed-fellow overpowered
every other consideration but that of pity
and grief for him. I had now my task to go through
again, and to enforce all I repeated with greater energy
and stronger assurances. At length, exhausted by contending
passions, poor Nicholls fell asleep, and I had
then recourse to my philosophy for self-consolation.</p>

<p>The next day, Mr. Newman requested, as a
favour, that I would continue to bear the unfortunate
Nicholls company during the week he had to live,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and in this request the latter also joined; so that I
could not without inhumanity refuse to comply, and
in this melancholy interval I omitted no opportunity
of contributing to his comfort. The night before
his execution, I also, by his own desire, sat up with
him: a very worthy and devout man, of his acquaintance,
accompanied by two other friends, also attended
him; and the greater part of the night was passed
in reading, exhortation, and singing hymns. Poor
Nicholls was, however, in a very low and desponding
state, and evidently dreaded the approach of death.
About three o’clock he was advised to lie down,
and sunk into a slumber from which he did not
wake till summoned by the keeper about six to
descend to the press-yard, the sheriffs, <i>&amp;c.</i>, being
shortly expected. I now took a solemn farewell
of him, and was removed to another cell. At eight
o’clock the doleful sound of the tolling bell announced
the awful ceremony, and he was a few
minutes afterwards launched into eternity; a woman
named Margaret Barrington, for forging and uttering
a seaman’s will, suffering with him. The fate of
this unhappy man, who was of a most inoffensive
and gentle disposition, and left a numerous family
to bewail his loss, affected me much.</p>

<p>I had now a new companion assigned me, a
young man about my own age, who was convicted
the day after myself, under what is called “Lord
Ellenborough’s Act.” His crime was shooting at<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
a person who had attempted to apprehend him in
the act of robbery; but his pistol flashed in the
pan, and no injury whatever had taken place. However,
the nature of the offence excluded him also
from any hopes of mercy, so that I had the fortune
to be placed in a second unpleasant situation, and
probably for a number of weeks. As to myself, I
had no reason to doubt of being reprieved, very few
persons suffering death at that time of day, except for
most heinous crimes, or robbery attended with acts
of violence. This young man, ’tis true, was a much
more tolerable companion than his predecessor;
he was always chearful and easy; declaring (although
he expected to suffer,) that, as he had never
seriously injured man, woman, or child, he was not
afraid to die; but rather happy at the prospect of
being released from a troublesome world. He had
formerly been transported, but made his escape from
the hulks; and the miseries he had witnessed and endured
onboard those horrid receptacles, he asserted
to be such that he preferred death to a reprieve, which
might subject him to years of similar suffering.</p>

<p>About eight days after my conviction, I was surprised
at being summoned to the main-gate of the
prison, to attend a gentleman who inquired for me.
This person proved to be an attorney named
Humphries, who, addressing me, stated that he
called by desire of counsellor Knapp, to inform me
that he (Mr. Knapp,) was sorry he had not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
present at my trial, and that he had discovered a
point of law, of which he hoped to avail himself so
far as to obtain a revocation of my sentence; that
he intended to submit this point to the judge who
tried me, and had instructed him (Mr. Humphries,)
to prepare a petition for the purpose, as it was Mr.
Knapp’s opinion that I ought not to have been
capitally convicted; but that nothing could be done
till after the close of the session, and I must receive
the sentence of death as a matter of form; adding,
that I might make myself perfectly easy, as there
was no danger of my suffering. I now inquired
of Mr. Humphries, of what nature was the point or
objection in question; but this limb of the law,
assuming an air of importance, answered that it
would be useless to explain it to me, as, if he did, I
should not comprehend it! I was, however, convinced
it related to the absence of the porter who
was present in Bilger’s shop, and who ought to
have attended my trial, for the reasons assigned in
the preceding Chapter. I, therefore, smiled at the
mean opinion he entertained of my understanding,
but replied, that it was very well; I should depend on
Mr. Knapp and on his (Mr. Humphries’,) good
offices: and here ended our interview. For brevity’s
sake, I shall inform the reader at once, that I never derived
any benefit from the intimation conveyed to me
by Humphries, although I several times wrote both to
him and Mr. Knapp. But I rather think it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
trick of the former, (who is a designing artful pettifogger,)
with a view of extorting money from me,
on pretence of drawing up petitions or other
documents in my behalf. I had, however, seen too
much of the world to be the dupe of an Old Bailey
solicitor. Two or three days after this event, the
session being concluded, the whole of the prisoners
convicted during their progress, were as usual taken
down to the court to receive sentence. Myself
and the other five men, together with two women,
were first put to the bar. When asked, in my turn,
what I had to say, “why judgment of death should
not pass upon me?” I answered, that my counsel
Mr. Knapp having intimated that he had discovered
a legal objection to my conviction, I humbly hoped
his Lordship would be pleased to respite the
judgment. The recorder replied, “Prisoner, your
request cannot be complied with; if your counsel
had any thing to offer in arrest of judgment, he
should have done so previous to the close of the
session. I must, therefore, pass sentence upon you.”
In this observation, I knew the recorder to be perfectly
right; and though I was induced to make the
trial, I had no hopes of gaining any thing by my
motion; and I was now more fully convinced that
either Mr. Knapp, or Mr. Humphries, or both, had
deceived me, and that I had been altogether very
shamefully neglected. His Lordship then proceeded
to pass the awful sentence in the usual form,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
which he prefaced with a very pathetic and impressive
address, that drew tears from the surrounding
auditors. The other prisoners were then put to the
bar in rotation, and variously sentenced; and among
those transported for seven years, was poor Bromley,
who, though capitally indicted, had the good fortune
to be convicted of simple felony only. Thus we
were both a second time convicted the same session,
as if his fate was involved in mine. He was, a few
weeks afterwards, sent on board the same hulk at
Portsmouth, in which he had before served seven
years; and as he never came to this colony, he will,
(if he survives,) in a few months be discharged, and
once more return to the scene of our former exploits.
I sincerely hope that his past sufferings
will, however, warn him to avoid a continuance of
his guilty courses, and to amend his life.</p>

<p>The recorder’s report to the King being, on some
accounts, delayed, I continued eleven weeks in the
cells, in which time the number of condemned
persons had increased to eighteen! At length, the
report was made. About eight o’clock on Friday
night, the 3d of May, Mr. Newman entered the
press-yard; and, as myself and companion listened
with palpitating hearts on their approach, we heard
one of the turnkeys utter the words “Cook
and Lowe.” I confess that at the moment, I
was under considerable alarm; which the reader
will allow to be natural, when he considers<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
that my fate was still doubtful, and that my life or
death depended on a single word from the keeper,
who came to announce it. Hearing our two names
particularly mentioned, as he advanced towards our
cell, was also a circumstance calculated to increase
our mutual terror. At length the door was unlocked;
and by this I knew that one of us, at least, was
doomed to suffer, because they always visit first
those who are ordered for execution. Mr. Newman
entering with a grave countenance, addressed poor
Cook in nearly the same terms he had done Nicholls
on a former occasion; then turning to me, he said,
“Lowe is respited.” My unhappy companion received
the melancholy news, as he had always declared
he should, with a cheerful aspect, nor appeared
in the least dismayed. The jailer having
withdrawn, Cook, after an inward struggle, assured
me he felt perfectly reconciled; and after I had
read to and consoled him for a short time, retired
to bed, and slept apparently with more composure
than usual. The next morning myself and the four
others who had been reprieved, (poor Cook being
the only one to suffer,) were, as usual, ordered to
return to our respective wards; but Cook begged so
earnestly that I would not quit him till the fatal
day, that I could not avoid complying. In this
period, his courage and resignation never once failed
him. The same worthy man who had attended
Nicholls, passed the last night with him, and I felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
a melancholy pleasure in bearing them company.
Cook, however, was so cheerful and well-prepared,
that he slept profoundly the greatest part of the
night, and, on being awaked at the usual hour,
appeared equally serene and happy. I obtained
leave to descend with him to the press-yard, where
he washed himself, brushed his coat, and seemed
pleased at his approaching release (as he termed
it). I then, at his earnest request, accompanied him
to the chapel, where he received the sacrament, of
which I partook. Some breakfast having been
prepared for him, he ate and drank with every
appearance of a good appetite; after which, his
irons being knocked off, and the hour approaching,
I took an affectionate farewell of the poor fellow,
who declared to me at parting, that he should go
out with as much pleasure as if he was going to a
fair or a race, and that he had rather die than live.
I then left him, and repaired to my own ward, through
the windows of which I saw him pass by to
execution; and he really appeared to verify the
promise he had made me; nodding, as he passed,
to his fellow-prisoners, and having as fine a colour
in his cheeks as ever I saw a man. I was informed
that he preserved this disposition to the last moment,
and died regretted by all who witnessed his deportment.
As I now knew the consequence of my being
respited, namely, that I was to be transported for
life, I became anxious to leave England by the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
ship for this colony, as I was not in circumstances
to subsist for any length of time in a prison; and I
wished, if possible, to avoid going to the hulks, as
I had been fortunate enough to do on my first
transportation. My wife, also, who had paid me
the most dutiful attention since my confinement,
was earnestly desirous to accompany me in my
exile; and, with that view, she waited on a gentleman
to whom I referred her, soliciting his interest to
obtain that favour; but, although he used every
effort, the application was refused, she having no
family, and the secretary of state having set his face
against such an indulgence, on account of the bad reports
received of those women who had already been
suffered to go out free with their husbands. I was
equally unsuccessful in my application to be sent
out by the ship Anne, which was on the point of
sailing. At length my wife received a private intimation
that I should be removed to the hulks
the next morning; in consequence of which, my
mother and sisters, whom I immediately summoned,
came to take leave of me. I had only acquainted
them with my misfortune since my being respited,
and they were of course equally astonished and
grieved at the news. My wife remained with me
that night, and at four o’clock in the morning, myself
and eleven others were conveyed by water on board
the Retribution hulk at Woolwich.</p>

<p>I had now a new scene of misery to contemplate;<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
and, of all the shocking scenes I had ever beheld,
this was the most distressing. There were confined
in this floating dungeon nearly six hundred
men, most of them double-ironed; and the reader
may conceive the horrible effects arising from the
continual rattling of chains, the filth and vermin
naturally produced by such a crowd of miserable
inhabitants, the oaths and execrations constantly
heard among them; and above all, from the shocking
necessity of associating and communicating more
or less with so depraved a set of beings. On
arriving on board, we were all immediately stripped,
and washed in large tubs of water, then, after putting
on each a suit of coarse slop-clothing, we were
ironed, and sent below, our own clothes being
taken from us, and detained till we could sell or
otherwise dispose of them, as no person is exempted
from the obligation to wear the ship-dress. On
descending the hatch-way, no conception can be
formed of the scene which presented itself. I shall
not attempt to describe it; but nothing short of a
descent to the infernal regions can be at all worthy
of a comparison with it. I soon met with many
of my old Botany Bay acquaintances, who were all
eager to offer me their friendship and services,—that
is, with a view to rob me of what little I had; for
in this place there is no other motive or subject for
ingenuity. All former friendships or connexions
are dissolved, and a man here will rob his best<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
benefactor, or even mess-mate, of an article worth
one halfpenny. Every morning, at seven o’clock, all
the convicts capable of work, or, in fact, all who are
capable of getting into the boats, are taken ashore
to the Warren, in which the royal arsenal and
other public buildings are situated, and are there
employed at various kinds of labour, some of them
very fatiguing; and while so employed, each gang
of sixteen, or twenty men, is watched and directed
by a fellow called a guard. These guards are most
commonly of the lowest class of human beings;
wretches devoid of all feeling; ignorant in the extreme,
brutal by nature, and rendered tyrannical
and cruel by the consciousness of the power they
possess; no others, but such as I have described,
would hold the situation, their wages being not
more than a day-labourer would earn in London.
They invariably carry a large and ponderous stick, with
which, without the smallest provocation, they will fell
an unfortunate convict to the ground, and frequently
repeat their blows long after the poor sufferer is
insensible. At noon the working party return on
board to dinner, and at one again go on shore, where
they labour till near sun-set. On returning on
board in the evening, all hands are mustered by a
roll, and the whole being turned down below, the
hatches are put over them, and secured for the
night. As to the food, the stipulated ration is very
scanty, but of even part of that they are defrauded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Their provisions being supplied by contractors, and
not by Government, are of the worst kind, such as
would not be considered eatable or wholesome
elsewhere; and both the weight and measure are
always deficient. The allowance of bread is said
to be about twenty ounces per day. Three days
in the week they have about four ounces of cheese
for dinner, and the other four days a pound of beef.
The breakfast is invariably boiled barley, of the
coarsest kind imaginable; and of this the pigs of
the hulk come in for a third part, because it is
so nauseous that nothing but downright hunger will
enable a man to eat it. For supper, they have, on
banyan days, burgoo, of as good a quality as the
barley, and which is similarly disposed of; and on
meat days, the water in which the beef was boiled, is
thickened with barley, and forms a mess called
“Smiggins,” of a more detestable nature than either
of the two former! The reader may conceive
that I do not exaggerate, when I state, that among
the convicts the common price of these several
eatables, is,—for a day’s allowance of beef, one
halfpenny;—ditto, of cheese, one halfpenny;—ditto,
of bread, three-halfpence; but the cheese is
most commonly so bad, that they throw it away.
It is manufactured, I believe, of skimmed milk
for this particular contract. The beef generally
consists of old bulls, or cows who have died of
age or famine; the least trace of fat is considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
a phenomenon, and it is far inferior upon the whole
to good horse-flesh. I once saw the prisoners
throw the whole day’s supply overboard the moment
it was hoisted out of the boat, and for this
offence they were severely flogged. The friends
of these unhappy persons are not allowed to come
on board, but must remain alongside during their visit;
the prisoners are, it is true, suffered to go into their
boat, but a guard is placed within hearing of their
conversation, and if a friend or parent has come one
hundred miles, they are not allowed above ten minutes’
interview; so that instead of consolation, the visit
only excites regret at the parties being so suddenly
torn asunder. All letters, too, written by prisoners,
must be delivered unsealed to the chief mate for his
inspection, before they are sent ashore; and such as
he thinks obnoxious, are of course suppressed. In
like manner, all letters received from the post-office
are opened and scrutinized. If I were to attempt
a full description of the miseries endured in these
ships, I could fill a volume; but I shall sum
up all by stating, that besides robbery from each
other, which is as common as cursing and swearing,
I witnessed among the prisoners themselves, during
the twelvemonth I remained with them, one
deliberate murder, for which the perpetrator was
executed at Maidstone, and one suicide; and that
unnatural crimes are openly committed.</p>

</div>

<p>From the description I have briefly given of the
hulks, the reader will easily believe I ardently
longed for the moment which was to release me
from so miserable an existence. That happy day
at length arrived. On the 15th of June, 1810, I
was removed from the Retribution, in company
with fifty-four others, to Long-reach, a few miles
below Woolwich, where we were put on board
the Indian, which ship had recently been fitted at
Deptford for the reception of two hundred prisoners.
The next day we sailed for Gravesend, and at this
place I anxiously hoped for a farewell visit from my
wife, to whom I had written from Woolwich on
the morning of my embarkation, acquainting her with
my approaching departure. She had attended me
at least once a month, during my stay at Woolwich,
and supported me as well as her circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
would permit. We remained at Gravesend three
days, but she did not appear; and in our progress
from thence to Spithead, we took on board at the
Nore forty-five more convicts from the Zealand
hulk at Sheerness. In a few days we arrived at
Spithead, where we received one hundred prisoners
from the hulks at Portsmouth, and Langston harbour;
soon after which I had a letter from my
wife, stating that she had arrived at Gravesend on
the evening of the day our ship departed, and
brought with her a supply of the most necessary
articles for my comfort; that on finding, to her
grief, that she was too late, she had been advised
to follow the ship to Sheerness; which she, in fact,
did, and arrived at that place on the very day after
we had taken in the prisoners, and immediately
proceeded on our voyage, without even coming to
an anchor. Thus she was again fatally disappointed;
and having incurred this expense, and endured
much fatigue, she had been obliged to return to
town; but added, that if possible, she would see me
before we sailed from Portsmouth. This, however,
she was not enabled to accomplish, her health and
circumstances being both unfavourable to the
undertaking. But I received, on the 18th of July,
when we were quite ready for, and in hourly expectation
of, sailing, a letter from her, in which she
expressed her concern at not being in a condition
to visit me; but gave me advice that she had packed<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
up some clothes and other necessaries, of which
she enclosed a list; and that the trunk containing
them would arrive by the Gosport coach at a
certain time and place. I had not received this
letter from the hands of our captain above half an
hour, when the Lion of 64 made the signal to
weigh; and from that moment no boat was permitted
to leave the ship, so that I went to sea without the
smallest comfort for the voyage, or any wearing
apparel except the suit of slops I had on. We
accordingly got under weigh immediately, and sailed,
in company with the Lion, and the Chichester
store-ship. The former had on board the Persian
ambassador and suite, and was bound for Bombay.
The latter was destined for St. Helena, and we
were to accompany them (under convoy,) as far as
the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope. We were
no sooner at sea, than Captain Barclay, who had
been induced to notice me from the recommendation
of a female passenger who was going out to
New South Wales, and who (singular to relate,)
had actually come home with me in H. M. Ship
Buffalo; the Captain, I say, from her representation
of my abilities, and from an application I made
to him by letter, treated me with peculiar kindness.
I was released from irons, and appointed to assist
the steward in the issue of provisions, <i>&amp;c.</i>, both to
the prisoners, the ship’s company, and the troops.
As the steward himself was not very expert, and an<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
indifferent scholar, I had the chief management of
the whole business, and the arrangement of all the
victualling accounts. From the experience I had
formerly gained, I was perfectly at home in this
situation, and gave satisfaction to all parties. I
also wrote the ship’s log-book, and executed many
services with my pen for Captain Barclay himself.
The effects of this favourable distinction and confidence
were, that I had every personal comfort the
ship afforded during our passage, lived tolerably
well, and accumulated a decent change of clothing
to equip myself on our arrival at Port-Jackson.
Nothing but the usual routine of occurrences befel
us in this voyage. We touched first at Madeira,
and afterwards at Rio-de-Janeiro, but our stay at
both places was short. The day after we quitted
the latter, in company with our Commodore and
the store-ship; both these vessels so far outsailed
us, that we lost sight of them and separated, continuing
our course alone without interruption, and,
with tolerable expedition, to the end of our voyage.
On the 16th of December, we anchored in Sydney-cove,
from which place I had been absent nearly
four years.</p>

<p>I soon learnt that the news of my second transportation,
and in fact of my principal adventures
in London, had preceded my own arrival; and that,
consequently, no surprise was excited by my appearance,
I also heard, to my mortification, that from<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
the changes which had taken place in public affairs
since my departure from the colony, most of the
departments were filled by strangers, from whom I
could expect no indulgence; and that not only these
officers, but the Governor himself, had conceived a
violent prejudice against those unfortunate and misguided
persons, who by a renewal of their vicious
courses on returning to their native country, subject
themselves to a second disgraceful banishment, and
seem thereby to indicate that they are incapable of
reformation, and systematically depraved. From
this intimation I had reason to expect a cool reception;
whereas, during my former residence in the
colony, I witnessed many instances of persons who
returned under the sentence of the law, being most
cordially received, and preferred to any vacant appointment
much sooner than a stranger. On the
24th of December, I was landed with the rest of
the prisoners, and the whole of us were drawn up
in the jail-yard for the Governor’s inspection. It
seems I had been particularly pointed out to his
Excellency; for on approaching me, he asked me
several questions respecting my employment under
Governor King, and concluded with desiring Mr.
Nicholls, the superintendent, to dispose of me at
present to the Hawkesbury. His Excellency, however,
paused a few moments before coming to this
decision, and I was in hopes he had an idea of giving
me a clerical employment. The Governor then<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
added, that if I behaved well, something might in
time be done for me, or to that effect. I was much
disappointed on this occasion, as I too well knew
the hardships I should have to encounter, if sent up
the country and assigned to a settler. However, it
was in vain to murmur, and about fifty of us were
immediately conveyed by water to Parramatta,
from whence we walked next day to Hawkesbury.
On arriving at the town of Windsor, the settlers
having been summoned by the magistrates, and
there being a greater number of applicants for men
servants than there were prisoners to dispose of, our
names were written on tickets, and intermixed with a
sufficient number of blanks, (we being the prizes at the
disposal of Dame Fortune,) and then each settler in
turn drew a ticket, which on being opened, published
the good or ill luck of the drawer. It was my fate
to be drawn by a settler called “Big Ben,” and
with him I quitted the scene of action, and prepared
to remove my little baggage to the farm of
my new master. As I had been intimately acquainted
with this man, and in fact with every inhabitant
of Hawkesbury, when I formerly officiated as clerk
to Mr. Baker, the store-keeper, I flattered myself
that he would treat me with more kindness, or at
least with less severity than a total stranger; and
every one who recollected me, declared I had been
fortunate in getting such a master; and that Ben, on
the other hand, could not have drawn a man more<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
eminently qualified to render him essential service;
as, although his agricultural and commercial speculations
were both extensive, he was himself perfectly
illiterate, and obliged to hire a free man to attend
him at stated times, and arrange his books. But I
soon found, to my sorrow, that I had little reason
for self-congratulation. ’Tis true, this ignorant and
good-for-nothing fellow was glad to avail himself of
my talents, and thereby save the expense he had
before incurred; but he thought it too much
to support me in a ration of provisions in return
for my services, though I should have been
satisfied therewith. His avarice was such, that he
expected me to act in the double capacity of his
clerk and labourer; and he accordingly measured
out the prescribed portion of ground which he required
me to break up with the hoe, well knowing
I had not been accustomed to hard labour, and
that I was in fact incapable of the task. My remonstrances
produced the most unfeeling replies
on his part, accompanied with threats of getting
me flogged, and every other species of tyrannical
persecution. This wretch, though now possessed
of thousands, was a few years ago one of the poorest
objects in the colony, and as defective in bodily
as in mental endowments; nor was his present
opulence so much the effect of laudable industry,
as of a natural low cunning he possessed, which
qualified him to take advantage of floods, temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
scarcities, and other casual events; and
becoming an adept in the arts of monopoly and extortion,
he by degrees attained the rank of a first-rate
settler, and, in the opinion of his dependants,
but much more so in his own, is a man of consequence.
His late prosperity has rendered him
over-bearing and cruel to his inferiors (I mean in
fortune,) while he is meanly servile to his superiors.
In fact, the old proverb “Set a beggar on horseback,”
<i>&amp;c.</i>, was never more aptly applied than to
“Big Ben.” According to the lately-established
custom, I had been assigned to this brute, by indenture,
for three years; but the misery of my situation
daily increasing, I determined to try every method
of obtaining my deliverance from his power. After
struggling with many hardships for about five weeks,
during which I was generally employed at some
laborious work in the field, or in drudgery about
the house, from morning till evening, and sleeping
in a barn over-run with vermin at night, I at length
found means, through the friendly aid of an acquaintance,
to escape from the hands of my persecutor,
though much against his will; and the reader may
judge of the malignity of his disposition by the
following circumstance. I must premise that I
could get away by no other means than counterfeiting
sickness; in consequence of which I was
ordered (by the humanity of the resident surgeon,)
to the general hospital at Sydney. It would appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
that Benn<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> suspected this stratagem, for, after trying
all he could to obstruct my success, he used these
remarkable words at parting, “Aye, you may go;—but
if you are six months in the hospital, I’ll have
you again when you come out. I know you’re of
no use to me, but I’ll keep you, if it’s only to torment
you.” However, as his avarice would not
allow him to send a fortnight’s ration with me to
the hospital, (in which case he might have reclaimed
me had I been then discharged,) I knew myself to
be effectually free from his further persecution; and
I had soon afterwards the pleasure to hear that he
had applied for, and obtained, another man in my
room. Indeed, so great was my aversion to this
unfeeling monster, that I was determined to endure
corporal or other punishment rather than have returned
to him: but surely, the threat he used on
my leaving him, ought, when made known, to have
precluded him from ever having it in his power to
realize so hellish an idea!</p>

<p>After a month’s confinement in the hospital I
was discharged and transferred to the town-gang,
in which, however, I laboured but a few weeks;
for a deputy-overseer of the jail-gang being wanted,
Mr. Nicholls, the superintendent, requested me to
undertake the office, which, he observed, would be
an introduction to something better, if I behaved
with propriety. I, therefore, gladly accepted the
offer, although neither the situation was lucrative,
nor its duties agreeable. I had, on landing from
the Indian, made a firm and solemn resolution never
again to deviate from the strictest probity, or to
subject myself any more to a repetition of those
sufferings which are the inevitable consequence of
irregular conduct. Knowing, by fatal experience,
the value of a good, or even an easy, employment, I
determined if I should ever again obtain an eligible<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
situation, to take proper care of it; and, I as solemnly
declare, notwithstanding my present condition, and
the punishment I have since endured, that I have
uniformly adhered to those resolutions; nor does
my conscience upbraid me with one single act at
which I ought to blush, since my arrival in the
colony. But the subject of the present Chapter will
prove that the best intentions of mankind are sometimes
thwarted and rendered abortive; and that a
person who is destined to be unfortunate, will be so,
<i>maugre</i> every exertion, and let him be never so circumspect.</p>

<p>Soon after my return to Sydney, I met with a
youth named Edwards, who had been my mess-mate
and bed-fellow on board the Indian, and for
whom I had conceived a particular regard. He informed
me that he lived as servant in the family of
Mr. Bent, the judge-advocate, where he had an
excellent place, and invited me to call and see him.
As I had rendered him many acts of service on the
voyage, he now wished, (he said,) having it in his power
to shew his gratitude for my kindness. Accordingly,
I called upon him twice, and saw him in his
master’s kitchen, (which was detached from the
dwelling-house,) in the presence of several other
servants. I told him I lived in the house of Mr.
Colles, in Philip-street, and should be happy to see
him when his leisure would permit. He soon afterwards
visited me, and treated me with some rum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Colles being a publican. Observing him to have a
considerable sum of money about him for a youth in
his situation, and knowing him to have been utterly
destitute on his landing, I expressed my surprise,
and earnestly cautioned him against any acts of
dishonesty which might endanger his losing so good
a place, and must, I assured him, inevitably bring
him to disgrace and ruin. He positively declared
that he had done no wrong; but that his mistress,
who was very partial to him, frequently gave him a
small sum for pocket-money, and that the gentry who
visited at his master’s, made him numerous and
handsome presents. I knew all this to be possible,
and I was the more inclined to believe him, because
(as he himself rightly observed,) he had no occasion
to use deceit with me, in whom he might safely have
reposed the fullest confidence. I, however, repeated
my cautions and advice, and we soon afterwards
parted. A few days having elapsed, he paid me a
second visit, and proposed that we should take a
walk together, which we accordingly did; and
having taken some refreshment, and amused ourselves
for a couple of hours, he quitted me and
returned home. I saw no more of Edwards for
about a week; when one day, as I sat at dinner
with Mr. Colles and his family, he came in rather
abruptly, and requested to speak with me. I rose
from the table, and taking him into an adjoining
room, he there took from his pocket several colonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
bills, and begged I would take care of them for an
hour or two, as something had occurred at his
master’s house, and he did not wish it to be known
that he possessed so much money. He also delivered
his watch into my care, and taking off one
of his shoes, produced from it another paper, which
he told me, in rather a significant manner, his
mistress had that morning given him. I saw something
so mysterious in this conduct, and my former
doubts were so far revived, that I hesitated, and
begged earnestly that he would not deceive me,
but confess if he had done any thing wrong;
adding that if I was fully apprized of the case, I
should be the better enabled to render him this
service, and to conceal the money more effectually,
without risking my own safety. This, indeed, I
only said with a view to come at the truth; for, had
he confessed to me what I suspected, though I
certainly should not have betrayed him, I was so
firmly resolved to avoid all improper connexions,
that I should have declined taking charge of the
money, and from that moment have dropped all
intercourse with him. He, however, so vehemently
protested his innocence, and urged me to oblige
him, repeating that he could have no motive for deceiving
me, that I suffered him to depart, which he
did as abruptly as he had entered. In fact, the whole
transaction did not occupy above five minutes, and
was so sudden and unexpected that I had no time<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
for reflection, and scarce knew what I did. On
his departure, I put the papers carelessly in my
waistcoat-pocket, and the watch in my fob, from
which the riband hung conspicuous. As to the
latter article, I knew it to be his own property,
having seen him wear it publicly for several weeks.
I now rejoined the family, and sat down to finish
my dinner. The cloth being drawn, I communicated
the particulars of my interview with Edwards to my
friend Colles, of whose experience and integrity I
had the highest opinion. I produced the papers
Edwards had given me, declaring that I felt uneasy
on the occasion, and wished him (Mr. Colles,) to advise
me how I should act. On looking over the papers,
we found about 5<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> in small colonial bills, and
the paper which Edwards took from his shoe, proved
to be a store-receipt for 8<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>! Colles expressed
his concern that I had suffered Edwards to leave
them at all, saying that he saw clearly through the
whole business; and earnestly advised me, for my
own security, to go immediately to the judge-advocate’s:
and, let who would be present, to return the
whole to Edwards in the most public manner, with
a declaration that I would have nothing to do with
them. This friendly advice I so far approved, that
I determined to follow it implicitly; but, unfortunately
for me, I proposed to smoke half a pipe
first, and declared I would then immediately go.
I had just lighted my pipe, and taken a seat near<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the door, which was open, when I heard somebody
approach, and turning my head, saw two constables
at the gate, who directly entered the house, and one
of them addressing me, said, he came with an order
to search my box. I, of course, felt a little confused,
but, conscious of my innocence, I boldly
answered that my box was at hand, and they were
welcome to search it; but requested to know what
they were seeking for, adding, that if I knew,
I might perhaps save them that trouble. One of
them replied, “It is something about the judge-advocate’s
servant.” I now instantly perceived that
I had but one part to act for my own preservation,
and in which I considered myself justified by the
palpable deceit Edwards had used towards me.
I, therefore, said that the young man they mentioned,
had just been with me, and left some property in
my care, which I would deliver up to them;
and accordingly produced the bills and the watch.
Immediately on seeing the store-receipt, they exclaimed,
“This is what we wanted.” They declared
that I had acted perfectly right in giving up
the property; but desired I would accompany them
to Mr. Redman, the chief-constable; and assured me
that my open conduct would undoubtedly acquit
me of any blame in the transaction. I willingly
attended them, and learnt by the way, that Edwards
was lodged in jail, on suspicion of robbing his
master. On arriving at Mr. Redman’s, the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
being informed of what had passed, desired I would
wait in his house until he had reported the whole
to Mr. Bent, and received that gentleman’s further
commands. In half an hour Mr. Redman returned,
and informed me that Mr. Bent fully approved of
my conduct, that I was at liberty to depart, and if
again wanted, I should be sent for. My friend
Colles expressed his approbation also, of the step I
had taken; but was sorry I had not anticipated the
constables, by going myself to the judge’s house the
moment he had so advised me; and for that omission
I certainly was highly blameable, and have since
severely suffered. The transaction above described
took place on a Friday, and I heard no more on the
subject till the following Monday, when going to
the jail at two o’clock to take out the working party,
I was met at the jail-door by Mr. Redman, who
informed me he was ordered by the Governor to
confine me in a cell. I was of course thunder-struck
at this intimation; but as the order was
peremptory, I submitted, and was immediately
locked up, after sending notice of my situation to
Mr. Colles. I remained in close confinement
during the whole week, in the course of which I
learnt that Edwards, who was lodged in another
cell, had undergone a private examination before
his master on the preceding Saturday, and it was
supposed he had (God knows falsely,) implicated
me as an accomplice in his guilt. The ensuing<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Saturday, I was taken before a bench of magistrates,
where I also met Edwards, but had no communication
with him. The latter was then called
for, and now appeared in the court, to my surprise,
as an approver, or evidence, against a woman known
by the name of Peggy the Miller, from her former
husband having been of that profession. This
woman had, unknown to me, been also confined
the whole week on Edwards’s accusation. I remained
among the crowd at the door of the court-house,
where I was enabled to hear the proceedings
I am now going to describe. Edwards deposed
that the said Margaret had lately quitted the service
of Mr. Bent, but had lived some time in the family
as his fellow-servant. That soon after deponent’s
coming to the house, she one day proposed to him
to take some money from his master’s writing desk,
and offered to procure him the keys for that purpose;
that he accordingly did so, and divided the
spoil (about 5<i>l.</i>,) with her. Being desired to proceed,
he continued, “A few days afterwards, she
again proposed to me to take some more money,
and I took about the same sum as before.” These
depositions being committed to writing, by the
court, and being extracted with some difficulty
from the witness, and attended with many questions
and remarks from the magistrates present<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, of
course occupied some time, and, on the court<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
desiring Edwards to go on, he was about to proceed
in the same words, “A few days after,” <i>&amp;c.</i>; but
the court, I suppose, conceiving him capable of
saying any thing in order to save himself, and, as he
could neither particularize any of the money or
bills, said to be so taken, trace their disposal, or
produce one single circumstance to corroborate
his assertions, they declined hearing any more, and
put the woman on her defence; who stated generally,
that every syllable of Edwards’s evidence was
false and malicious; that during her residence in
the family, she had such frequent opportunities of
observing the conduct of Edwards, and so much
reason to believe he was in the constant habit of
pilfering, that, out of regard to her own safety,
being a free woman, and to prevent her being
unjustly suspected, she one day requested her
mistress to discharge her, and on being questioned
as to her motives for such a wish, and pressed
to continue in her place, she evaded a full explanation,
but consented to continue on condition of
Mrs. Bent herself keeping the keys of the various
drawers, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and not suffering them to lie about as
they had hitherto done. That she had reason
to believe this conversation had come to the
knowledge of Edwards; for the latter soon afterwards
grossly abused her, and threatened to stab
her with a knife, if ever he found that she told any
tales of him, or pryed into his proceedings. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
supposing her mistress, from this circumstance, to
be too much prepossessed in his favour, and fearing
the consequences of Edwards’s wicked disposition,
she had accordingly persisted in requesting, and
finally obtained, her discharge; since which she
had married an industrious mechanic, and lived in
good repute. The court was now cleared, and
after some deliberation re-opened, when the bench
informed her, that the evidence of Edwards being
unsupported by any other testimony, the court
were of opinion the charge had not been substantiated,
and she was therefore discharged from custody.
During the preceding examination, Edwards
had never once mentioned my name, but accused
this woman as his sole accomplice, and every person
present, as well as myself, concluded I should be
immediately liberated; but the woman had no sooner
retired, than I was called to the bar, and stood
charged, together with Edwards, “with breaking
open the writing-desk of Ellis Bent, Esquire, and
stealing thereout several sums of money!” To this
charge, Edwards, who appeared no longer capable
of dissimulation, pleaded “Guilty.” I, of course,
solemnly denied any knowledge of, or participation in,
his guilt; and briefly stated the part I had acted, calling
upon Mr. Colles, Mr. Redman, and the two constables,
to corroborate my account, which they did
in every particular I have before recited. The
court then appearing to hesitate, Mr. Cubitt, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
jailer, with an over-officious zeal to shew himself
assiduous, produced a written paper, which he
stated to be the declaration or confession of Edwards,
when taken before the judge, his late master,
on the day after his apprehension; adding, that the
court might perhaps wish to hear it. To this, the
members assenting, one of them accordingly read
to the following effect; “That Edwards confessed
having repeatedly robbed his master’s desk of
money, in which practice he had been solely aided,
abetted, and encouraged by Vaux! That Vaux
had contrived an instrument in order to pick the
lock of the writing-desk; and that on one occasion,
Vaux happening to come without his instrument,
had made use of a fork, one prong of which he
bent for the purpose! That another time he had
made use of a large nail! and that the nail now
produced, which had been found on Mr. Bent’s
premises, was the identical nail so used! [This
nail Cubitt exhibited to the court; it was a common
nail with a brass head, about four inches long,
and the point appeared to have been turned by
driving it in a stone or brick wall.] That Edwards and
Vaux had jointly taken by these means at various times
about sixty pounds, which had been equally shared
between them.” This improbable account, one
would suppose, could have excited no other sensation
than that of laughter; for, could it be seriously
entertained for a moment, that with such instruments<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
as those he described, a man could possibly open
so minute a lock as that of a writing desk, and
afterwards re-lock it so securely as to escape detection?
The fact, doubtless, was, that Edwards,
who had access to his master’s keys, had himself
committed the depredation without the aid of any
other person or instrument. All this I submitted
to the court, and further desired them to consider
the situation in which I stood, being merely
accused by a very wicked youth, who had already
confessed his own guilt, and had laboured to implicate
an innocent woman, as the court had declared
her to be. I then dwelt on the candour and openness
of my conduct respecting the money he had left
with me, which I could have effectually concealed,
had I been at all privy to the guilt of Edwards;
and I called Mr. Colles, who swore, “That I had
resided in his house since the day of my discharge
from the hospital; that during that period (about
six weeks,) I had lived a most orderly and regular
life; and that he had never seen me possessed of
any money except a half-crown bill, which he himself
gave me to pay for my washing.” I concluded
with observing, that Edwards himself, having confessed
his crime, could, if he thought proper to tell
the truth, at once acquit me of any share in his
guilt. The court then asked me, “If I was willing
to trust myself to Edwards’s answer, if they questioned
him on the subject?” I answered, that bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
as he had proved himself, I could not believe him
so totally depraved as to persist in the wicked story
he had before told, now that he was standing at my
elbow, and could no longer hope to extricate himself
at my expense; and I, therefore, begged he might be
questioned. The bench then asked Edwards, “If
there was any truth in the story he had told his
master about Vaux?” when, to my surprise and
unspeakable horror, he answered, (hanging down
his head,) “Yes, Gentlemen, it is, every word of
it, true!”</p>

<p>Mr. Redman now stated to the court, that on
Mr. Bent missing this store-receipt from his desk,
he had sent for him; and informing him that he
suspected his servant Edwards to have been in the
habit of robbing him, as he had frequently missed
small bills which he could not identify, requested
he, Mr. Redman, would endeavour to find out
what connexions the youth had formed, with a
view to the detection of his guilt, and, if possible to
trace the receipt in question, which he had but that
morning deposited in his desk, and should be enabled
to recognise by the number and other particulars.
Upon which Mr. Redman answered,
that he recollected seeing Edwards pass by his
house one evening in company with me, and supposed
we might be intimate; that Mr. Bent then
desired he would have my lodgings searched, which
(after consigning Edwards to custody,) he had proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
to do in the manner I have above related.
The court was now a second time cleared, and nearly
an hour occupied in consultation; when Edwards
and myself were again called in, and the bench informed
Edwards, that he, having confessed his guilt,
the court had sentenced him to receive one hundred
lashes at the cart’s tail, in the streets of Sydney,
and to be kept to hard labour in the jail-gang for
twelve months. Then, addressing me, the bench
observed that the evidence of Edwards not appearing
to the court entitled to much credit, and being
unsupported by other testimony, the court acquitted
me of any share in the actual robbery of Mr. Bent;
but were of opinion that I had been privy to the
guilt of Edwards, and had received the money
from him, knowing it to be stolen! and they had
therefore sentenced me also to twelve months
labour in the jail-gang. Thus ended an examination,
which I believe is scarcely to be paralleled in
the records of a court, either as to its foundation,
progress, or result; and I now found to my cost,
that I was in this instance also, the victim of an unjust
prejudice, for one of the members (who shall be
nameless,) said to me, in the course of the proceedings,
“Recollect, Mr. Vaux, this is the second time
of your being sent to this colony; we know you
well.” I answered, with secret, and, I hope
justifiable indignation, “Surely, Sir, that ought not
to operate against me, if my conduct has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
uniformly good since my late arrival, and I trust
that will bear the test of inquiry.”</p>

<p>I have since learned that Edwards, after his being
committed to jail, having heard that I had given
up the money he left with me, conceived I had
acted treacherously towards him; and, therefore,
with the double motive of injuring me, and palliating
his own guilt, had the next day requested to be
taken before his master, and feigning contrition,
had then fabricated the vile and improbable story
recited by Cubitt to the court; artfully judging
that I being much older than himself, should be
considered the most culpable, and he as an innocent
youth, led astray by my machinations.</p>

<p>After receiving our sentence, the corporal part
of which was severely inflicted on Edwards, I continued
to labour in the jail-gang for about three
weeks, when, by an order from the Governor, as I
understood, both myself and Edwards were double-ironed,
put on board a government vessel, with
several other prisoners, and transported to Newcastle,
commonly called the “Coal river,” without
any definite term being fixed for our exile; and as
we were both prisoners for life, it was uncertain
how long our banishment might be protracted.</p>

<p>On arriving at Newcastle, I was first employed
in wheeling coals out of the mines, a most laborious
occupation indeed; but during my continuance at
that settlement, I was put to all descriptions of
work, and for the last three months, performed the
duty of a constable, or watchman. Since the day
on which the transaction at Colles’s took place, I
never exchanged a word with the villain Edwards.
He had been but a few weeks at Newcastle, before
he committed a robbery, and absconded to the
woods, from which he was brought back by some
natives a naked and miserable object. His subsequent
conduct at the coal river exhibited nothing
but a succession of robberies, and every species of
depravity; when detected in which, on several
occasions, he betrayed his accomplices, and proved
as perfidious as he was dishonest. He frequently
escaped by land, amidst innumerable hardships,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
to Sydney; where, after the commission of
some robbery, he was uniformly apprehended, and
sent back to Newcastle. In fact, though scarce
twenty years of age, nothing was wanting to fill up
the measure of his wickedness, but the blackest of
all crimes,—an act of murder! and, as if he laboured
to attain the summit of human depravity, that
act he soon afterwards virtually committed; for
being at length, on one of his elopements from the
coal river, apprehended and lodged in Sydney jail,
at a period when many prisoners, of bad character,
were about being embarked for the settlements on
Van Diemen’s land, Edwards was included in the
number. He there renewed his iniquitous courses;
associating with a band of ruffians, who escaped to
the woods, and there subsisted by plundering the
settlers, robbing on the highway, <i>&amp;c.</i> A party of
these miscreants (eight in number,) were one day
attacked by some armed persons, who had assembled
together, and gone in pursuit of them; a serious
conflict ensued, the marauders, also, being well
armed; and after several shots had been exchanged,
the settlers were obliged to retreat, several of their
number being severely wounded, and one killed on
the spot by the fire of the free-booters. The consequence
of this outrage was, that the whole of the
latter were immediately declared by proclamation
to be in a state of outlawry, and a large reward
offered for the apprehension of all or either of them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
As parties of military, as well as the inhabitants,
were detached in all directions, there is no doubt
but the whole of these desperadoes have long since
received the due reward of their villany. This
account I read in a Sydney Gazette a few months
ago, and among the names of the bush-rangers, (as
they are termed,) who jointly committed the above
outrage and murder, I was shocked, though not
surprised, to see that of the young, but depraved,
Edwards!</p>

<p>Having continued nearly two years at the coal-river,
the commanding officer was induced, in consideration
of my uniform good behaviour, to permit
my return to Sydney, on my arrival at which
place, I was once more disposed of in the town-gang.
Being advised to solicit the Governor for an
appointment to some less laborious employment, I
waited on His Excellency with a petition, in which
I urged my exemplary behaviour for the last two
years at Newcastle; as a proof that whatever my
former conduct might have been, I was now disposed
to reform; and entreating His Excellency to
divest himself of that prejudice which I feared had
already operated against me too severely, humbly
prayed that he would make trial of me in the only
capacity in which I was capable of being useful,
namely, that of a clerk in one of the public-offices.
Unhappily for me, the cloud was not yet dispelled,
but threatened to obscure, still longer, the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of advancement and prosperity which I had in vain
sighed for, and fondly pictured to myself as the
certain consequence of a thorough reformation in
principle. The Governor very coolly answered
that it was not merely my having behaved well for
two years at the coal-river, but I must conduct
myself with propriety for a series of years, before I
could expect, or ought to apply for, any mark of
indulgence. This answer was certainly disheartening
in the extreme; and I was equally unsuccessful
in an application to the then acting commissary,
William Broughton, Esq., who, although he never
saw me until my arrival in the Indian, not being in
the colony during my former term of exile, yet this
gentleman, from hearing only of my repeated frauds
while employed in the office of Governor King,
(and which no doubt were much exaggerated by
report and repetition after my departure for Europe,)
had conceived so violent a dislike to me,
that he gave me a decisive, though civil, denial;
and I have since heard, that he declared I should
not hold a situation in the commissariat, if there
was not another clerk in the colony. God grant
that some well-disposed christian, who reads these
Memoirs of my unhappy Life, may induce this
gentleman, for whose shining talents and excellent
qualities I have the highest respect, to retract his
discouraging declaration, and to admit me to an
employment, however subordinate, in his department,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
which, as I am now situated, forms the <i>ne
plus ultra</i> of my ambition.</p>

<p>To resume my narrative: finding from these disheartening
failures, that I had nothing to hope for
but a continuance of suffering and bodily fatigue,
far above my strength, for many succeeding years,
perhaps for the remainder of my life; surely no
dispassionate reader will pronounce me culpable,
or consider that I deviated from the resolutions
I had formed, to act correctly while I lived, if I
listened with eagerness to an offer of assistance in
effecting my escape from a state of bondage which
became every day more irksome and galling, in
proportion as I reflected that my inoffensive conduct
fairly entitled me to a share of that favour
and indulgence I every day saw extended to objects
I knew less worthy than myself. In fact, a person
belonging to the Earl Spencer, Indiaman, then on
the point of sailing for Ceylon and Bombay, did,
in the month of January, 1814, from motives of
pure and disinterested compassion, propose that I
should conceal myself, with his assistance, on board
that ship, and promised me every support in his
power. I accepted with joy and gratitude this unexpected
offer, and, without any difficulty, got on
board, and, as I thought, effectually concealed, on
the night of the Queen’s birth-day. I lay close and
undiscovered for four days, and on the fifth had
the pleasure to hear that the ship would that day<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
finally sail, she having already dropped down the
harbour. But, how often is the cup of happiness
dashed from the lips of mortals! On the 23d of
January, about ten o’clock in the forenoon, my
friend came to me in my place of concealment,
and informed me that upwards of thirty constables
were come on board to search the ship, for that
so many prisoners were missing from their respective
employments, that the Governor would not
suffer the ship to depart until they were found.
He, however, assured me it was very unlikely any
search would take place in the spot I was in, and,
indeed, I considered it next to impossible that I
could be discovered, unless I was betrayed. I
remained in a state of the utmost anxiety for three
hours, during which a vigilant search was making
in every other part of the ship; not by the constables,
for they would have been unequal to the
task, but by a mate of the vessel, assisted by several
sailors. At length, I heard voices approaching,
and eagerly listening, I was convinced by the discourse
which passed between the parties, that they
knew exactly where I was concealed, and that I
really had been, by somebody, most villanously
betrayed. In a moment the mate advanced, as it
were mechanically, towards me, and thrusting his
candle into the entrance of my hiding-place, desired
me, in a peremptory tone, to come out. Thus were
my fond hopes of liberty and happiness effectually<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
destroyed. I had become a second time the victim
of treachery; but as more than one person, besides
my principal abettor, knew of my concealment, I
was at a loss whom to suspect as the informer. I
was now ordered into a boat alongside, in which
were about a dozen other men and several women,
who had been found concealed in various situations.
The search being not yet over, I remained alongside
the ship above an hour, in which time the number
of ill-fated persons collected in the boat had
increased to twenty-seven men and four women.
The ship having now been thoroughly ransacked,
the search was given up, and the persons taken out
were brought ashore, attended by the constables.
We were all immediately lodged in gaol; and the
next day, a report having been made to the Governor,
His Excellency was pleased to order each
man to be punished with fifty lashes in the public
lumber yard. This sentence was certainly as lenient
as could be expected for such an attempt (I do not
say offence) as we had been guilty of, had the
punishment stopped there; but, extraordinary to
relate, although we had been all equally culpable
and were found under the same circumstances, a
distinction was subsequently made, which I cannot
help still considering unfair and unmerited. The day
after the corporal punishment had been inflicted,
twenty-three of our number were ordered to return
to the respective employments in Sydney, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
which they had severally absconded, and myself and
three others were sentenced by the Governor to be
sent to the coal-river for one year; for this distinction,
there appears to have been no other reason,
but because we had each of us before suffered a
similar banishment, and had been but a few months
returned from thence to Sydney! In a few days, I
was accordingly embarked with eleven other prisoners,
and a second time landed at Newcastle,
from whence I had been absent nearly twelve months.
On my arrival, it happened that the store-keeper of
that settlement was in want of a clerk, and he, applying
to the commandant for me, I was appointed
to that situation, in which I still continue; and
having scrupulously adhered to my former vows of
rectitude, and used every exertion to render myself
serviceable to my employer, and to merit his good
opinion, as well as that of the commandant, I have
had the satisfaction to succeed in these objects;
and I am not without hope, that when I am permitted
to quit my present service and return to
Sydney, my good conduct will be rewarded with a
more desirable situation. I have now been upwards
of seven years a prisoner, and knowing the
hopeless sentence under which I labour, shall, I
trust, studiously avoid in future every act which
may subject me to the censure of my superiors, or
entail upon me a repetition of those sufferings I
have already too severely experienced. I have thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
described (perhaps too minutely for the reader’s
patience) the various vicissitudes of my past life.
Whether the future will be so far diversified as to
afford matter worthy of being committed to paper,
either to amuse a vacant hour, or to serve as a
beacon which may warn others to avoid the rocks
on which I have unhappily split, is only known to
the great Disposer of events.</p>

<p class="noindent">SIR,</p>

<p>With the utmost deference and respect, I beg leave
to submit to your perusal the following sheets. The idea
of such a compilation first originated in the suggestion
of a friend; and however the theme may be condemned
as exceptionable by narrow minds, I feel confident you
possess too much liberality of sentiment to reject its
writer as utterly depraved, because he has acquired an
extensive knowledge on a subject so obviously disgraceful.
True it is, that in the course of a chequered and
eventful life, I have intermixed with the most dissolute
and unprincipled characters, and that a natural quickness
of conception, and most retentive memory, have rendered
me familiar with their language and system of
operations.</p>

<p>Permit me, Sir, to assure you most seriously, that I
view with remorse the retrospect of my hitherto misspent
life, and that my future exertions shall be solely<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
directed to acquire the estimable good opinion of the
virtuous part of the community.</p>

<p>I trust the Vocabulary will afford you some amusement
from its novelty; and that from the correctness of
its definitions, you may occasionally find it useful in
your magisterial capacity.</p>

<p>I cannot omit this opportunity of expressing my
gratitude for the very humane and equitable treatment I
have experienced, in common with every other person in
this settlement<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, under your temperate and judicious
government.</p>

<p class="center">I have the honour to remain,<br>
with the most dutiful respect,</p>

<p>AREA SNEAK, or AREA SLUM, the practice of
slipping unperceived down the areas of private houses,
and robbing the lower apartments of plate or other
articles.</p>

<p>ARM-PITS. To <i>work</i> under <i>the arm-pits</i>, is to practise
only such kinds of depredation, as will amount, upon
conviction, to what the law terms single, or petty larceny;
the extent of punishment for which is transportation
for seven years. By following this system, a thief
avoids the halter, which certainly is applied <i>above</i> the
arm-pits.</p>

<p id="AWAKE">AWAKE, an expression used on many occasions; as
a thief will say to his accomplice, on perceiving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
person they are about to rob is aware of their intention,
and upon his guard, <i>stow it</i>, the <i>cove’s awake</i>.
To be awake to any scheme, deception, or design,
means, generally, to see through or comprehend it.</p>

<h3>B</h3>

<p>BACK-JUMP. A back-window. <i>See</i> <a href="#JUMP"><span class="smcap">Jump</span></a>.</p>

<p>BACK-SLANG, to enter or come out of a house by
the back-door; or, to go a circuitous or private way
through the streets, in order to avoid any particular
place in the direct road, is termed <i>back-slanging it</i>.</p>

<p>BACK-SLUM, a back room; also the back entrance
to any house or premises; thus, we’ll <i>give it</i>
’em <i>on the back-slum</i>, means, we’ll get in at the back-door.</p>

<p>BAD HALFPENNY. When a man has been upon
any errand, or attempting any object which has proved
unsuccessful or impracticable, he will say on his return,
It’s a <i>bad halfpenny</i>; meaning he has returned as
he went.</p>

<p>BANDED, hungry.</p>

<p id="BANDS">BANDS. To <i>wear the bands</i>, is to be hungry, or short
of food for any length of time; a phrase chiefly used on
board the hulks, or in jails.</p>

<p>BANG-UP. A person, whose dress or equipage is
in the first style of perfection, is declared to be <i>bang
up to the mark</i>. A man who has behaved with extraordinary
spirit and resolution in any enterprise he has
been engaged in, is also said to have <i>come bang up to
the mark</i>; any article which is remarkably good or<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
elegant, or any fashion, act, or measure which is carried
to the highest pitch, is likewise illustrated by the same
emphatical phrase.</p>

<p>BARKING-IRONS, pistols; an obsolete term.</p>

<p>BARNACLES, spectacles.</p>

<p>BASH, to beat any person by way of correction, as
the woman you live with, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

a cant name for the House of Correction, Cold-Bath-Fields,
London.</p>

<p>BEAK, a magistrate; the late Sir John Fielding, of
police memory, was known among <i>family</i> people by the
title of the blind <i>beak</i>.</p>

<p>BEAN, a guinea.</p>

<p>BEEF, stop thief! to <i>beef</i> a person, is to raise a hue
and cry after him, in order to get him stopped.</p>

<p>BELLOWSER. <i>See</i> <a href="#WIND"><span class="smcap">Wind</span></a>.</p>

<p>BENDER, a sixpence.</p>

<p>BENDER, an ironical word used in conversation by
<i>flash</i> people; as where one party affirms or professes any
thing which the other believes to be false or insincere,
the latter expresses his incredulity by exclaiming <i>bender</i>!
or, if one asks another to do any act which the latter
considers unreasonable or impracticable, he replies, O yes,
I’ll do it—<i>bender</i>; meaning, by the addition of the last
word, that, in fact, he will do no such thing.</p>

<p>BEST, to <i>get your money at the best</i>, signifies to live
by dishonest or fraudulent practices, without labour or
industry, according to the general acceptation of the latter
word; but, certainly, no persons have more occasion to
be industrious, and in a state of perpetual action than<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
<i>cross-coves</i>; and experience has proved, when too late,
to many of them, that honesty is the best policy; and,
consequently, that the above phrase is by no means
<i>à-propos</i>.</p>

<p id="BETTY">BETTY, a picklock; to <i>unbetty</i>, or <i>betty</i> a lock, is
to open or re-lock it, by means of the <i>betty</i>, so as to

<p>BLEEDERS, spurs.</p>

<p>BLOODY-JEMMY, a sheep’s head.</p>

<p>BLOW THE GAFF, a person having any secret in
his possession, or a knowledge of any thing injurious to
another, when at last induced from revenge, or other
motive, to tell it openly to the world and expose him
publicly, is then said to have <i>blown the gaff upon</i> him.</p>

<p>BLOWEN, a prostitute; a woman who cohabits with
a man without marriage.</p>

<p>BLUE-PIGEON, lead.</p>

<p>BLUE-PIGEON FLYING, the practice of stealing
lead from houses, churches, or other buildings, very
prevalent in London and its vicinity.</p>

<p>BLUNT, money.</p>

churchyards; which are sold to the surgeons and students
in anatomy.</p>

<p id="BOLT">BOLT, to run away from or leave any place suddenly,
is called <i>bolting</i>, or <i>making a bolt</i>: a thief observing an
alarm while attempting a robbery, will exclaim to his
accomplice, <i>Bolt</i>, there’s <i>a down</i>. A sudden escape
of one or more prisoners from a place of confinement is
termed <i>a bolt</i>.</p>

<p id="BOLT-IN-TUN">BOLT-IN-TUN, a term founded on the cant word
<i>bolt</i>, and merely a fanciful variation, very common
among <i>flash</i> persons, there being in London a famous
inn so called; it is customary when a man has run
away from his lodgings, broke out of a jail, or made
any other sudden movement, to say, The <i>Bolt-in-tun</i> is
<i>concerned</i>; or, He’s gone to the <i>Bolt-in-tun</i>; instead of

future operations, so as to avoid the like misfortune.</p>

<p id="BONNET">BONNET, a concealment, pretext, or pretence; an
ostensible manner of accounting for what you really
mean to conceal; as a man who actually lives by depredation,
will still outwardly follow some honest employment,
as a clerk, porter, newsman, <i>&amp;c.</i> By this system
of policy, he is said to have a good <i>bonnet</i> if he happens
to get <i>boned</i>; and, in a doubtful case, is commonly discharged
on the score of having a good character. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
<i>bonnet for</i> a person, is to corroborate any assertion he

<p>BOUNCE, to bully, threaten, talk loud, or affect

to obtain goods of a tradesman, by assuming the appearance
of great respectability and importance, so as to
remove any suspicion he might at first entertain. A
thief, detected in the commission of a robbery, has been
known by this sort of finesse, aided by a genteel appearance
and polite manners, to persuade his accusers of
his innocence, and not only to get off with a good grace,
but induce them to apologize for their supposed
mistake, and the affront put upon him. This masterstroke

disgrace; or, three men being concerned alike in any
transaction, two of them will form a collusion to <i>bridge</i>
the third, and engross to themselves all the advantage
which may eventually accrue. Two persons having been
engaged in a long and doubtful contest or rivalship, he,
who by superior art or perseverance gains the point, is
said to have <i>thrown</i> his opponent <i>over the bridge</i>. Among
gamblers, it means deceiving the person who had
back’d you, by wilfully losing the game; the money so
lost by him being shared between yourself and your confederates
who had laid against you. In playing three-handed
games, two of the party will play into each
other’s hands, so that the third must inevitably be <i>thrown

where any certain sum or payment is spoken of; a man
asking for money due to him for any service done, or a
<i>blowen</i> requiring her previous compliment from a <i>family-man</i>,
would say, Come, <i>tip</i> us <i>the dues</i>. So a thief, requiring
his share of booty from his <i>palls</i>, will desire them
to <i>bring the dues to light</i>.</p>

<p>DUES. This word is often introduced by the lovers
of <i>flash</i> on many occasions, but merely <i>out of fancy</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
can only be understood from the context of their discourse;
like many other cant terms, it is not easily explained
on paper: for example, speaking of a man
likely to go to jail, one will say, there will be <i>quodding
dues concerned</i>, of a man likely to be executed; there
will be <i>topping dues</i>, if any thing is alluded to that will
require a fee or bribe, there must be <i>tipping dues</i>, or
<i>palming dues concerned</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

the busy hours, and sometimes meet with valuable prizes.</p>

<p id="FAKE">FAKE, a word so variously used, that I can only
illustrate it by a few examples. To <i>fake</i> any person or
place, may signify to rob them; to <i>fake</i> a person, may
also imply to shoot, wound, or cut; to <i>fake</i> a man
<i>out and out</i>, is to kill him; a man who inflicts wounds
upon, or otherwise disfigures, himself, for any sinister
purpose, is said to have <i>faked himself</i>; if a man’s shoe
happens to pinch, or gall his foot, from its being over-tight,
he will complain that his shoe <i>fakes</i> his foot sadly;
it also describes the doing any act, or the fabricating any
thing, as, to <i>fake</i> your <i>slangs</i>, is to cut your irons in order
to escape from custody; to <i>fake</i> your <i>pin</i>, is to create a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_172"></a>[172]</span>

<p id="FAKEMENT">FAKEMAN-CHARLEY; FAKEMENT. As <i>to
fake</i> signifies to do any act, or make any thing, so
<i>the fakement</i> means the act or thing alluded to, and on
which your discourse turns; consequently, any stranger
unacquainted with your subject will not comprehend
what is meant by <i>the fakement</i>; for instance, having
recently been concerned with another in some robbery,
and immediately separated, the latter taking the
booty with him, on your next meeting you will inquire,
what he has done with the <i>fakement</i>? meaning the
article stolen, whether it was a pocket-book, piece of linen,
or what not. Speaking of any stolen property which has
a private mark, one will say, there is a <i>fakeman-charley</i>
on it; a forgery which is well executed, is said to be a
<i>prime fakement</i>; in a word, any thing is liable to be
termed a <i>fakement</i>, or a <i>fakeman-charley</i>, provided the person
you address knows to what you allude.</p>

<i>fancy article</i>; as, a <i>fancy clout</i>, is a favourite handkerchief,

latter emphatically styled <i>a square cove</i>, whereas an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
thief who has acquired an independence, and now confines
himself to <i>square</i> practices, is still called by his
old <i>palls</i> a <i>flash cove</i>, who has <i>tyed up prigging</i>. <i>See</i>
<a href="#CROSS"><span class="smcap">Cross</span></a> and <a href="#FLAT"><span class="smcap">Flat</span></a>. In making a bargain or contract, any
overture considered to be really fair and reasonable, is
declared to be <i>a square thing</i>, or to be <i>upon the square</i>.
To be <i>upon the square</i> with any person, is to have mutually
settled all accompts between you both up to that
moment. To threaten another that you will be <i>upon the
square with him</i> some time, signifies that you’ll be even
with him for some supposed injury, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

observe, or take notice of them.</p>

<p>STAINES, a man who is in pecuniary distress is said
to be <i>at Staines</i>, or <i>at the Bush</i>, alluding to the Bush inn
at that town. <i>See</i> <a href="#BUSHD"><span class="smcap">Bush’d</span></a>.</p>

<p>STAKE, a booty acquired by robbery, or a sum of
money won at play, is called <i>a stake</i>, and if considerable,
<i>a prime stake</i>, or a <i>heavy stake</i>. A person alluding
to any thing difficult to be procured, or which he obtains
as a great favour, and is therefore comparatively invaluable,
would say, I consider it <i>a stake</i> to get it at all; a<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
valuable or acceptable acquisition of any kind, is emphatically
called <i>a stake</i>, meaning a great prize.</p>

<p id="STALL">STALL, a violent pressure in a crowd, made by pickpockets
for the more easily effecting their depredatory
purposes; this is called <i>making a rum stall in the push</i>.</p>

<p>STALL OFF, a term variously applied; generally it
means a pretence, excuse, or prevarication—as a person
charged with any fault, entering into some plausible
story, to excuse himself, his hearers or accusers would
say, O yes, that’s a good <i>stall off</i>, or, Aye, aye, <i>stall it off</i>
that way if you can. To extricate a person from any
dilemma, or save him from disgrace, is called <i>stalling</i>
him <i>off</i>; as an accomplice of your’s being detected in a
robbery, <i>&amp;c.</i>, and about to be given up to justice, you will
step up as a stranger, interfere in his behalf, and either
by vouching for his innocence, recommending lenity, or
some other artifice, persuade his accusers to forego their
intention, and let the prisoner escape; you will then
boast of having <i>stalled him off in prime twig</i>. To avoid
or escape any impending evil or punishment by means of
artifice, submission, bribe, or otherwise, is also called
<i>stalling</i> it <i>off</i>. A man walking the streets, and passing a
particular shop, or encountering a certain person, which
or whom he has reasons for wishing to avoid, will say to
any friend who may be with him, I wish you’d <i>stall</i> me
<i>off from</i> that <i>crib</i>, (or <i>from</i> that <i>cove</i>, as the case may be)
meaning, walk in such a way as to cover or obscure me
from notice, until we are past the shop or person in
question.</p>

<p>STALL UP. To <i>stall</i> a person up, (a term used by<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
pickpockets,) is to surround him in a crowd, or violent
pressure, and even sometimes in the open street, while
walking along, and by violence force his arms up, and
keep them in that position while others of the gang rifle
his pockets at pleasure, <i>the cove</i> being unable to help or
defend himself; this is what the newspapers denominate
hustling, and is universally practised at the doors of
public theatres, at boxing matches, ship-launches, and
other places where the general anxiety of all ranks, either
to push forward, or to obtain a view of the scene before
them, forms a pretext for jostling, and every other advantage
which the strength or numbers of one party gives
them over a weaker one, or a single person. It is not
unusual for the <i>buz-coves</i>, on particular occasions, to procure
a formidable squad of stout fellows of the lower
class, who, though not expert at <i>knuckling</i>, render essential
service by violently pushing and squeezing in the
crowd, and, in the confusion excited by this conduct, the
unconcerned <i>prigs</i> reap a plentiful harvest, and the
<i>stallers up</i> are gratified with such part of the gains acquired,
as the liberality of the <i>knuckling</i> gentlemen may
prompt them to bestow. This <i>coup de guêrre</i> is termed
<i>making a regular stall</i> at such a place, naming the scene
of their operations. <i>See</i> <a href="#STALL"><span class="smcap">Stall</span></a>.</p>

<p>STAMPS, shoes.</p>

<p>STAND THE PATTER. <i>See</i> <a href="#PATTERD"><span class="smcap">Patter’d</span></a>.</p>

<p>STAR. <i>The star</i> is a <i>game</i> chiefly practised by
young boys, often under ten years of age, although the
offence is capital. It consists of cutting a pane of glass
in a shop-window, by a peculiar operation called <i>starring
the glaze</i>, which is performed very effectually by a common<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
penknife; the depredators then take out such articles
of value as lie within reach of their arm, which if they
are not interrupted, sometimes includes half the contents
of the window. A person convicted of this offence is
said to have been <i>done for a star</i>.</p>

<p>START. <i>See</i> <a href="#PITCHER"><span class="smcap">Pitcher</span></a>.</p>

<p id="STASH">STASH. To <i>stash</i> any practice, habit, or proceeding,
signifies to put an end to, relinquish, or quash the
same; thus, a thief determined to leave off his vicious
courses will declare that he means to <i>stash</i> (or <i>stow</i>)
<i>prigging</i>. A man in custody for felony, will endeavour,
by offering money, or other means, to induce his prosecutor’s
forbearance, and compromise the matter, so as
to obtain his liberation; this is called <i>stashing the business</i>.
To <i>stash</i> drinking, card-playing, or any other employment
you may be engaged in, for the time present,
signifies to <i>stow</i> it, <i>knife</i> it, <i>cheese</i> it, or <i>cut</i> it, which are all
synonymous, that is, to desist or leave off. <i>See</i> <a href="#WANTED"><span class="smcap">Wanted</span></a>.</p>

<p>STASH IT. <i>See</i> <a href="#STOW_IT"><span class="smcap">Stow it</span></a>, which has the same

already been trick’d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>STINK. When any robbery of moment has been committed,
which causes much alarm, or of which much is
said in the daily papers, the <i>family people</i> will say, there
is a great <i>stink</i> about it. <i>See</i> <a href="#WANTED"><span class="smcap">Wanted</span></a>.</p>

<p id="STOW_IT">STOW, STOW IT; or STOW FAKING, an intimation

which his auditor believes to be false, or spoken in
jest, or wishes the former to recant, the latter will say,
<i>stow that</i>, if you please, or, <i>cheese that</i>; meaning don’t
say so, or that’s out of the question.</p>

<p>STRETCH. Five or ten <i>stretch</i>, signifies five or ten
yards, <i>&amp;c.</i>; so in dealing for any article, as linen, <i>&amp;c.</i>, I
will give you <i>three hog</i> a <i>stretch</i>, means, I’ll give three
shillings a yard. <i>See</i> <a href="#HOG"><span class="smcap">Hog</span></a>.</p>

<p id="SUIT">SUIT, in general synonymous with <i>game</i>; as, what
<i>suit</i> did you <i>give it to ’em upon</i>? in what manner did you
rob them, or upon what pretence, <i>&amp;c.</i>, did you defraud
them? One species of imposition is said to be <i>a prime
suit</i>, another <i>a queer suit</i>: a man describing the pretext
he used to obtain money from another, would say, <i>I
draw’d</i> him <i>of a quid upon the suit of</i> so and so, naming
the ground of his application. <i>See</i> <a href="#DRAW"><span class="smcap">Draw</span></a>. A person
having engaged with another on very advantageous terms
to serve or work for him, will declare that he is <i>upon a
good suit</i>. To use great submission and respect in asking
any favour of another, is called <i>giving it to him upon
the humble suit</i>.</p>

<p>SWAG, a bundle, parcel, or package; as a <i>swag</i> of
<i>snow</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>The swag</i>, is a term used in speaking of any
booty you have lately obtained, be it of what kind it
may, except money, as Where did you <i>lumber the swag</i>?
that is, where did you deposit the stolen property?
To carry <i>the swag</i> is to be the bearer of the stolen goods
to a place of safety. <i>A swag</i> of any thing, signifies
emphatically a great deal. To have <i>knap’d</i> a good
<i>swag</i>, is to have got a good booty.</p>

<p>SWAG. Wearing-apparel, linen, piece-goods, <i>&amp;c.</i>, are
all comprehended under the name of <i>swag</i>, when describing

genteel figure, is said by his associates to be <i>in swell street</i>.
Any thing remarkable for its beauty or elegance, is
called <i>a swell article</i>; so <i>a swell crib</i>, is a genteel house;
<i>a swell mollisher</i>, an elegantly-dressed woman, <i>&amp;c.</i> Sometimes,
in alluding to a particular gentleman, whose name
is not requisite, he is styled, <i>the swell</i>, meaning the person
who is the object of your discourse, or attention; and
whether he is called <i>the swell</i>, <i>the cove</i>, or <i>the gory</i>, is
immaterial, as in the following (in addition to many other)
examples:—I was <i>turned up</i> at <i>China-street</i>, because <i>the
swell</i> would not appear; meaning, of course, the prosecutor:
again, speaking of a person whom you were on the
point of robbing, but who has taken the alarm, and is
therefore on his guard, you will say to your <i>pall</i>, It’s of
no use, <i>the cove</i> is as <i>down as a hammer</i>; or, We may as
well <i>stow it, the gory’s leary</i>. <i>See</i> <a href="#COVE"><span class="smcap">Cove</span></a> and <a href="#DOWN"><span class="smcap">Down</span></a>.</p>

until he or she can find means to <i>stash the business</i> through
the medium of <i>Mr. Palmer</i>, or by some other means.</p>

<p>WATER-SNEAK, robbing ships or vessels on a navigable
river, or canal, by getting on board unperceived,
generally in the night. <i>The water-sneak</i>, is lately made
a capital offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p id="WEAR_IT">WEAR IT, to <i>wear it upon</i> a person, (meaning to <i>wear
a nose</i>, or <i>a conk</i>,) is synonymous with <i>nosing</i>, <i>conking</i>,
<i>splitting</i>, or <i>coming it</i>, and is merely one of those fanciful
variations so much admired by <i>flash people</i>.</p>

<p>WEAR THE BANDS. <i>See</i> <a href="#BANDS"><span class="smcap">Bands</span></a>.</p>

<p>WEDGE, silver; as a <i>wedge-feeder</i>, a silver-spoon,
<i>&amp;c.</i>; but silver coin, as well as silver plate, are both comprehended
under the name of <i>wedge</i>. <i>See</i> <a href="#RIDGE"><span class="smcap">Ridge</span></a>, and
<a href="#SPEAK_TO"><span class="smcap">Speak to</span></a>.</p>

<p>WEED, tobacco.</p>

<p>WEED, to pilfer or purloin a small portion from a large
quantity of anything; often done by young or timid depredators,
in the hope of escaping detection, as, an apprentice
or shopman will <i>weed</i> his master’s <i>lob</i>, that is, take
small sums out of the till when opportunity offers, which
sort of peculation may be carried on with impunity for a
length of time; but experienced thieves sometimes think
it good <i>judgment</i> to <i>weed</i> a place, in order that it may be
<i>good</i> again, perhaps for a considerable length of time, as
in the instance of a warehouse, or other depôt for goods,
to which they may possess the means of access by means
of a false key; in this case, by taking too great <i>a swag</i>, at
first, the proprietors would discover the deficiency, and
take measures to prevent future depredation. To <i>weed the
swag</i> is to embezzle part of the booty, unknown to your
<i>palls</i>, before a division takes place, a temptation against
which very few of <i>the family</i> are proof, if they can find an
opportunity. A <i>flash-cove</i>, on discovering a deficiency in
his purse or property, which he cannot account for,
will declare that he, (or it, naming the article,) has been
<i>wedded to the ruffian</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>WEEDING DUES, speaking of any person, place,
or property, that has been <i>weeded</i>, it is said <i>weeding dues</i>
have been concerned. <i>See</i> <a href="#DUES"><span class="smcap">Dues</span></a>.</p>

<p>WEIGH FORTY, term used by the police, who are
as well versed in <i>flash</i> as the thieves themselves. It is
often customary with the <i>traps</i>, to wink at depredations of
a petty nature, and for which no reward would attach,
and to let a thief <i>reign</i> unmolested till he commits a
capital crime. They then <i>grab</i> him, and, on conviction,
share (in many cases) a reward of 40<i>l.</i>, or upwards;
therefore these gentry will say, Let him alone at present,
we don’t <i>want</i> him till he <i>weighs his weight</i>, meaning, of
course, forty pounds.</p>

<p id="WELL">WELL, to <i>well</i> your accomplice, or <i>put him in the
well</i>, is explained under the word <a href="#GARDEN"><span class="smcap">Garden</span></a>, which <i>see</i>.</p>

<p>WHIDDLE, to speak of, or mention any thing, as,
Don’t you <i>whiddle</i> about so and so, that is, don’t mention
it.</p>

not fit to be trusted with a secret.</p>

<p>WHISTLERS. <i>See</i> <a href="#BROWNS_AND_WHISTLERS"><span class="smcap">Browns and Whistlers</span></a>.</p>

<p>WIN, or WINCHESTER, a penny.</p>

<p id="WIND">WIND, a man transported for his natural life, is said
to be <i>lag’d for his wind</i>, or to have <i>knap’d a winder</i>, or
<i>a bellowser</i>, according to the humour of the speaker.</p>

<p>WOOLLY-BIRDS, sheep.</p>

<p>WORK. To <i>work upon</i> any particular <i>game</i>, is to
practise generally, that species of fraud or depredation,
as, He <i>works upon the crack</i>, he follows house-breaking,
<i>&amp;c.</i> An offender having been detected in the very fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="VOLUME_II_Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
particularly in cases of coining, colouring base-metal,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, is emphatically said to have been <i>grab’d at work</i>,
meaning to imply, that the proof against him being so
plain, he has no ground of defence to set up.</p>

<p>WRINKLE, to lie, or utter a falsehood.</p>

<p>WRINKLE, an untruth.</p>

<p>WRINKLER, a person prone to lying; such a character
is called also <i>a gully</i>, which is probably an abbreviation
of Gulliver, and from hence, to <i>gully</i> signifies
to lie, or deal in the marvellous.</p>

<h3>Y</h3>

<p id="YARN">YARN, <i>yarning</i> or <i>spinning a yarn</i>, is a favourite
amusement among <i>flash-people</i>; signifying to relate their
various adventures, exploits, and escapes to each other.
This is most common and gratifying, among persons in
confinement or exile, to enliven a dull hour, and probably
excite a secret hope of one day enjoying a repetition
of their former pleasures. <i>See</i> <a href="#BONED"><span class="smcap">Boned</span></a>. A person
expert at telling these stories, is said to <i>spin a fine
yarn</i>. A man using a great deal of rhetoric, and exerting
all his art to talk another person out of any thing he
is intent upon, the latter will answer, Aye, Aye, you can
<i>spin a good yarn</i>, but it won’t do; meaning, all your
eloquence will not have the desired effect.</p>

<i>yellow gloak</i>.</p>

<p>YOKUFF, a chest, or large box.</p>

manner, is termed <i>yorking</i>; to <i>york</i> any thing,

<p>YORK, a look, or observation; a <i>flash-cove</i> observing
another person (<i>a flat</i>) who appears to notice or scrutinize
him, his proceedings, or the company he is with,
will say to his <i>palls</i>, That <i>cove</i> is <i>yorking as strong as a
horse</i>, or, There is <i>York-street concerned</i>.</p>

the Governor’s displeasure, was at this period banished to Newcastle,
a place of punishment for offenders: these sheets were
